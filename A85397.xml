            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:112049:3"/>for that purpoſe, either by my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries in the mentioned Diſcourſe, or any other I can meet with.

Or in caſe you ſhall deny me this, that you will give me in the ſtead thereof (that which will be of equal, or rather of ſuperior conſideration to me) better reaſons and grounds for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie opinion, then I here deliver for mine. It is of ſweet and comfortable importance, to be accompanied in the way of a mans judgement, by thoſe that are learned and religious: yet is it much more deſirable of the two, to be turned a ſide out of a way of error by an high hand of evidence and truth.</p>
            <p>Since <hi>God</hi> ingaged me in theſe and ſome other controverſies, and the oppoſitions of men grew ſtrong and thick upon me, I have beſtowed ſome time and thoughts to finde out and poſſeſſe my ſelfe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch conſiderations, which might
<pb facs="tcp:112049:4"/>make me willing, yea &amp; more then willing (if it might be) rejoycingly willing, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſuch opportunities, wherein I may exchange error for truth. And if <hi>God</hi> hath not given me darkneſſe for a viſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I apprehend a marveilous bewtie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and bleſſing in ſuch a frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which makes a man able, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and joyfull, to caſt away even long endeered and profeſſed opinions, when once the light hath ſhone upon them, and diſcovered them to be but darkneſſe. I looke upon ignorance and error and all miſpriſion in the things of <hi>God,</hi> and of the glorious Goſpell of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as that region in the ſoule, wherein only dolefull creatures, as Owles and Satyrs, and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, I meane feares and terrors and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, ſpirituall tumults, and ſtormes and tempeſts are ingendred and begotten. If all were light and truth in the judgment, all would be peace and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and joy in the heart and ſoule Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to me it is no more grievous to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don any opinion whatſoever, being once
<pb facs="tcp:112049:4"/>cleerely detected, and ſubſtantially evicted for an error, then it is to be delivered out of the hand of an enemy, or to take hold of life and peace. But on the other hand, it argues childiſhneſſe in underſtanding, and a bundle of weakneſſe &amp; folly bound up in the heart, to be baffled out of a mans judgment with every light and looſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. The raine fell as ſore, and the floods came with as great rage; and the winds blew with as much violence againſt the houſe that was built upon the rock, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which was built upon the Sand: yet that fell not, as this did <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.25, 26, 27. In like manner many opinions that are built upon the Rock and Foundations of the Scriptures, being truths of very deere and precious importance, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of aſmuch oppoſition and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from men, may have Forts and Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes and Batteries of as much ſtrength in apearance, raiſed up againſt them, as opinions that are looſe, and lighter in the ballance then vanitie it ſelfe; yet are they not therefore to be forſaken. I preſume
<pb facs="tcp:112049:5"/>my keene Adverſary himſelfe, had his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience bin pleaſed to have awaited the ſight and conſideration of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and frame of my diſcourſe, would have kept his Sword in his Scabberd, and not drawne upon me with that violence and extremity of paſſion which now he hath done.</p>
            <p>However, I have preſumed to follow him in the way of his Dedication: (<hi>fas est et ab hoſte doceri</hi>) knowing none more able then your ſelves to comprimize a difference of this nature, according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and truth, and withal deſiring none more indifferent and upright to give an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then I hope to finde a competent number (at leaſt) of you. I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but you all ſtudie of conſcience, and then you cannot make fleſh your arm. I crave leave to be your remembrancer of this, that ſuſpicion of falſhood hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bin a calamitie incident to truth. Nor can the integritie, zeale, faithfulneſſe, parts, learning, diligence of a Miniſter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> quit or expreſſe themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:112049:5"/>upon more honourable and worthy termes, then in vindicating and relieving a diſtreſſed truth, and breaking the ſtaffe of the oppreſſors thereof, be they never ſo many in number, never ſo great in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power. The only art and method of raiſing an eſtate of honour and peace out of our errors, is by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing them upon the honour and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the truth. This is a way to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent the great circumventer the Divell, and to turne his weapons upon himſelfe. He ſends errors out of Hell, to curſe the truth: but by this meanes you ſhall cauſe them to bleſſe her altogether. Truth never gets up into her throne with that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as when her enemy (the oppoſite error) is made her footeſtoole.</p>
            <p>If we have built tymber, hay, or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, upon the precious foundation <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> inſtead of ſilver, gold, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, it is a point of the greateſt wiſdome under Heaven, to prevent the triall of the fire, by a ſerious and ſtrict examination of our own, or from our
<pb facs="tcp:112049:6"/>Errors, together with other looſe and light materialls in our ſpirituall build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, leave us ſalvation indeed, but upon the hardeſt and leaſt deſirable termes that it can be received by a creature.

And yet loath I am, that men of hard language or thoughts, ſhould fall ſofter any where, or where they might take leſſe harme, then upon me: For <hi>God</hi> having graciouſly pleaſed to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileings &amp; repoaches of men ſuch benefactors unto me, as he hath done, hath put a golden bridle in my lips, to keepe me in from much ſharpneſſe of complaint or conteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:112049:8"/>them.

It is an eaſy matter to forgive injuries, after that GOD hath once altered their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and turned them into bleſſings. Beſides, my hope is, that thoſe who are or have bin zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for ſuppoſed truths, will be zealous for truth indeed, when they come to ſee it: and in this caſe, I can freely ſet the one againſt the other, my hope againſt my experience, and ſo let my complaint fall. But as touching the hard meaſure which I have received from men, my beſt ſatisfaction reſteth in this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that GOD is both able to pardon the offendors, and to recompence the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Diſcourſe it ſelfe, I can reaſonably expect no better, then to ſee and heare it vexed from all quarters, with a ſpirit of zeale in ſome, of learning in others, of wiſdome in a third, and of indiſcretion in a fourth ſort of men. The firſt will crie out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, <hi>Hereſie, Blaſphemy, Socinianiſme, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme, &amp;c.</hi> without any more adoe, and with a, <hi>what need we any more witneſſes?</hi> The verdict of the ſecond (it is like) will be, error and noveltie. The profound and ſage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the third, Uſeleſſeneſſe and non-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.
<pb facs="tcp:112049:9"/>The ſober and ſoft exception of the laſt, unſeaſonableneſſe, and, better at another time.</p>
            <p>For anſwere to the two firſt, which are the grand objections, the whole Treatiſe it ſelfe is engaged, and (I make no queſtion) will doe reall and thorough execution. If any man hath the leaſt minde or inclination to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied touching the Doctrines here maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that there is neither <hi>Hereſie</hi> nor <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> neither <hi>Socinianiſme</hi> nor <hi>Arminiariſme,</hi> neither error nor noveltie in them, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Diſcourſe it ſelfe will abundantly gratify him herein. But <hi>he that is full</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, <hi>loatheth the hony-comb</hi> of ſatisfaction, Only to the charge and imputation of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie (beſides what is effectually layd down in the enſuing diſcourſe for the healing of this exulceration in the Spirits of men) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſuggeſt a few things here by the way.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that <hi>America,</hi> though lately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto us on this ſide of the World, was yet as ancient a Land and part of the World, as either <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>Europe</hi> it ſelfe. And what prohibition can there be ſerv'd out of the Scriptures upon any tenet or opinion in Religion, to arreſt it for error or untruth, or to prove it not to have bin of as ancient Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and ſtanding as any other truths profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt us, only becauſe we never ſaw the face or heard the name of it till yeſterday? Might not nay did not, the Synagogue of
<pb facs="tcp:112049:9"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> upon the ſame pretence, blaſpheme and quarell againſt all that glorious light brought into the Church by <hi>Luther</hi> and his compeeres in the daies of that reformation, and brought it under the cenſure and condemnation of darkneſſe? If ſo great and conſiderable a part of the world as <hi>America</hi> is, being as large as all the other three ſo long knowne (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an eight or there-abouts) was yet unknowne to all the world beſides, for ſo many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together: well may it be conceived, not only that ſome, but many truths, yea and thoſe of maine concernment and importance, may be yet unborne, and not come forth out of their Mothers womb (I meane the ſecrets of the Scriptures) to ſee the light of the Sun; eſpecially conſidering, of how eaſy &amp; ready a diſcovery viſible things are, &amp; by Name, lands and great tracts of Earth, in compariſon of things that are Spirituall, and thoſe eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whoſe ſcituations and dwellings are farre remot from the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> road or walk of mens ſtudies and underſtandings: as alſo how poor and barren and empty the viſible world is, of ſecrets and things to be known, and how ſoon the contents thereof may be read over and underſtood, in compariſon of the infinite and endleſſe varietie of the riches and treaſures of the Scripture, and the unknown abyſſe of truth there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Scriptures themſelves give us a propheticall intimation of this, that in
<pb facs="tcp:112049:10"/>and towards the latter ages of the world, their foundations (as it were) ſhall be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and their great depths broken up, and that <hi>knowledge ſhall abound, as the waters cover the face of the Sea. But thou, oh Daniel</hi> (ſaith the Angell to him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4) <hi>ſhut up the words and ſeale the booke even to the time of the end</hi> [meaning that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould ſo carrie the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of this part, at leaſt, of his prophecie, that it ſhould not be cleerely underſtood till the drawing neere of the time wherein it is to be fulfilled: and then] <hi>many ſhall runne to and fro,</hi> [that is, ſhall diſcourſe and beate out the ſecrets of GOD in the Scriptures with more libertie and freedome of judgement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and traverſe much ground to and againe, on which no man ſhould ſet foot, till that time] <hi>and knowledg</hi> [by this meanes] <hi>ſhall be increaſed.</hi> Much more might be added from the Scriptures in this particular.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that no man is competently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and <hi>inſtructed to the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> that is, for the Miniſterie of the Goſpell, and promoting the affaires of the Kingdome of Heaven that way,
<note place="margin">

                     </gap>t.</hi> 13.25.</note> 
               <hi>but he that is like unto a man an houſeholder, which bringeth forth out of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, things new &amp; old:</hi> i. who is not aſwel able, to make ſom new diſcoverie, &amp; to bring forth ſomwhat of himſelfe in the things of <hi>God</hi> in one kinde or other, as to preach the common and received truths.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that there are thouſands of
<pb facs="tcp:112049:10"/>Scriptures, that have not yet opened, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out their treaſures, but reſerve them as the proper and peculiar glory of the generations of the CHURCHES yet to come.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that many interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, anciently delivered by <hi>Chryſoſtom, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and others of the Fathers, are wholly deſerted by <hi>Luther, Calvin, Muſculus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther late Divines, and others of a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering importance ſubſtituted in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that ſeverall opinions, not only maintained by ſome ſpeciall Father, one or more, as thoſe lately mentioned, or the like, but even ſuch as generally ruled in the Church for ſome ages together, have beene waved, yea and ſtrongly oppoſed by their ſucceſſors. It were eaſy to inſtance, were not brevitie the greater neceſſitie of the two.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that divers interpretations of Scriptures, eſpecially in the old Teſtament, and of ſome in the new, delivered by <hi>Luther, Calvin, Muſculus</hi> and other learned and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> Writers of that Centurie, are ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, yea and more then ſuſpected, even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected of miſpriſion and miſtake, by many of the moſt learned of this age.</p>
            <p>Eightly, that is neither new, nor unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the practiſe of wiſe men, to examine, yea and to impugne received opinions, if they
<pb facs="tcp:112049:11"/>be found erroneous. He that will pleaſe to peruſe the firſt Chapter of the firſt Booke of Doctor <hi>Hakewills</hi> learned Apologie of the Power and providence of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall meet with great varietie of inſtances and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, both in Divinitie, Philoſophy, in Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, in Civil or Nationall Hiſtorie, in Naturall Hiſtorie, of opinions which had a long time bin generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and yet were at laſt ſuſpected, yea and many of them evicted and rejected, upon due examination.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, that there are now many errors (erroneouſly ſo called) in the Chriſtian World, which are made of the greateſt and choyceſt truths: yea and which (doubtleſſe) will be redeemed from their captivitie, and reſtored to their Thrones and Kingdomes, by the diligence, guifts and faithfulneſſe of the approaching generation.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, that it is of ſweet conſiſtence with the providence of <hi>God,</hi> and with the known method of his diſpenſations, <hi>to put honour upon that which lacketh,</hi> to diſcover and reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſome particulars, unto thoſe that are weake and of leſſe eſteeme in the Church, wherein he reſerv's himſelfe from perſons of farre greater light and knowledge otherwiſe, and which are <hi>counted pillars</hi> of the Church, as is ſaid of <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> &amp; <hi>John.

            </p>
            <p>Eleventhly, that to oppoſe and crie downe for error, every thing that is not generally received and taught, is to quench proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to interdict unto the Churches, growth in the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, increaſe and growth in grace alſo. 2 <hi>Peter.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, that notwithſtanding al that hath bin ſaid for the vindication of new apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or opinions, ſubſtantially prooved from the Scriptures, yet the Doctrine maintained in the following Diſcourſe, hath no need of any ſanctuary in this kinde to protect it, being nothing but what hath an armie both of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and moderne worthies to make it good. Inſomuch that as touching the two maine points avouched herein, <hi>viz.</hi> the imputation of Faith for righteouſneſſe (in the ſenſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the entrance of the Diſcourſe) and the non-imputation of the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in the ſenſe diſclaimed) I here make this open, ingenuous, and ſolemne profeſſion, that what I cannot pregnantly and irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly demonſtrate (to any unpartiall and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged judgment) to have bin both ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held and taught by the chiefe Fathers of the Primitive times, as likewiſe by the beſt and moſt conſiderable part (at leaſt) of the
<pb facs="tcp:112049:12"/>late Reformed Writers, <hi>Luther, Calvin, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon, Muſculus, Pareus, &amp;c</hi> (at leaſt if their judgements and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Onely this I muſt confeſſe, that few of theſe Authors alwaies ſpeake ſo even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſteadily, but that ſome expreſſions from their pens, are very obnoxious and opportune for a contrary interpretation. But my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that take them either in their more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and conſtant expreſſions, or in their more perſpicuous and cleere expreſſions, they cannot but by an unprejudicate eye be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned fairely to ſympathize in judgement with the points mentioned. As for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, it is (as Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> modeſtly enough expreſſeth his judgement) to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>that for more then a few ages together, it was unknown to all Antiquitie</hi>

            <p>Secondly, that the leaſt haire, I meane the leaſt jot or tittle of divine truth, is more worth a thouſand fold then our whole heads, yea then all our heads put together. One tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the word (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) is greater then Heaven and Earth. And in another place: nothing in the Scriptures is to be thought lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in aſmuch as the Holy Ghoſt would not have cauſed that to be written, which ſhould not be profitable, which conſideration drew from him many ſuch expreſſions as theſe: Curſed be that charitie and agreement, which muſt be preſerved and kept with the danger of the word of God: and againe, Curſed be that charity, which is kept with the loſſe of the Doctrine of Faith, unto which all things muſt give place, charity, Apoſtle, Angell from
<pb facs="tcp:112049:13"/>Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was the ſaying of another, that that peace is more grievous then any Warre, which coſts the loſſe of truth and honeſty. But the Lord Chriſt himſelfe gives us the beſt and moſt certaine account of the infinite worth and value of the leaſt ſtrictures or filings of the word of God, in that paſſage to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 18, 19. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, till Heaven and Earth paſſe, one jot or one title ſhall in no wiſe paſse from the Law, till all things be fulfilled. Whoſoever therefore ſhall breake one of theſe leaſt commandements and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, but whoſoever ſhall do and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Doubtleſſe if God ſo highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth the aniſe, mint, and cummin of his Law, as to recompence the tithing of them with ſuch high preferment in the Kingdome of heaven; much more (or at leaſt every whit as much) doth he eſteeme, the jots and titles, the meaneſt and leaſt conſiderable things of his Goſpell, which is his darling and moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved manifeſtation of himſelfe unto the world. And therfore it muſt needs argu much prophaneneſſe of heart, and great eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in minde and ſpirit from the worth and excellencie of the things of God, either to deſpiſe the knowledg, or to cenſure a juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion and examination of the ſmalleſt of them, as a thing needleſſe, and of little uſe. <hi>Hierom</hi> was farre from ſuch a conceit as this,
<pb facs="tcp:112049:13"/>when he ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In Scripturis me minima differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia omitti debet. Nam ſinguli ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes, ſyllaba, apices et puncta, plena ſunt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> 
               <hi>that the ſmalleſt difference in the Scriptures was not to be lightly paſsed over, becauſe every word, ſyllable, title and point, are full of ſenſe and meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is very conſiderable, that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſions and errors in Divinity, aſwell as in other arts and Sciences, goe (as it were) by tribes and families; ſo that there is no one error, but hath many more link'd in affinitie with it, and related to it, ſome greater (it may be) and more dangerous then it ſelfe, and ſome leſſer. Now when a mans judgement is match'd into a ſtock or linage of error, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be but with the lighteſt and leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in all the tribe, yet is he engaged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to owne and maintaine all the reſt of the ſame deſcent and blood, be they never ſo foule and dangerous, and if he be true to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, cannot But do it.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.20.</note> So that <hi>Lots</hi> plea to the <hi>Angell</hi> for the ſparing of <hi>Zoar, is it not a little one?</hi> is at no hand to be admitted for the ſparing of an eror. A ſmall eror cannot light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be favored or connived at, but that great errors will be comprehended in the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence alſo. The foundation of a building may be endammaged and at laſt periſh, by the raine or wet that ſalls through the roofe, and ſettles upon it. So may the judgment ſoone come to be corrupted and tainted in the great and fundamentall points of Religion, if it hath once miſcaried in others that ſeeme at firſt to be of harmleſſe conſequence, and farre
<pb facs="tcp:112049:14"/>enough off from the foundation: Therefore it was a provident and prudent ſaying, from whomſoever it came: <hi>Minimum non eſt, non negligere minima.</hi> that is, It is not a thing of the leaſt conſequence, to looke after things that ſeeme to be of the leaſt. The judgment will corrupt and putrifie aſwell downwards as upwards, though I conceive it corrupts ſooneſt and faſteſt upwards. A man that at firſt ſets in, and couples himſelfe with a great or fundamentall error, is farre more apt to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and ſwallow all leſſer errors depending thereon, then he that is firſt tainted with a lighter error only, is to admit of thoſe that are more dangerous, though of the ſame ſtock &amp; lineage. Therfore</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to condemne or cenſure the teaching and ſearching out of any truth, but what is of preciſe and abſolute neceſſitie to be knowne unto ſalvation, as impertinent and needleſſe, favours of much ignorance and prophaneneſſe. For 1. what underſtanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will undertake to make any ſuch umpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage betweene the things or truths of God, that ſhall determine theſe or theſe by name, and no other, to be of abſolute neceſſitie to ſalvation? Or where hath God given any Commiſſion or authoritie to men, to make any ſuch election and reprobation as this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his divine truths? Secondly, it is much to be feared, that thoſe that are ſo wiſe as not to trouble themſelves about knowing
<pb facs="tcp:112049:14"/>any thing, but what is of an abſolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory neceſſitie to ſalvation, will prove ſo fooliſh, as not to know ſo much. He that will conſtantly walke as neere the edg or brink of a ditch or pit, as is poſſible, runn's a deſperate hazard of falling in, firſt or laſt. It is a ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> that it is not poſſible for a man to be ſaved, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reading or ſtudying ſpirituall things
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Chryſ. Hom.</hi> 3. <hi>do LaZ.</hi>
               </note>. Thirdly, to deſire or care to know nothing more in the things of God, then what is of preciſe neceſſitie to ſalvation, is farre more unfavoury, then to labour or care for nothing more in outward things, as in meates, drinks, apparrell <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then what is of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to keepe life and ſoule together, or not to eate one morſell of bread more, or drink the leaſt drop of water more, then without which nature muſt of neceſſitie give up the Ghoſt. As ſuch a deſire or reſolution as this, in the way of nature were very unnaturall, and neere unto monſtrous: ſo is that temper and frame of Spirit hardly (if at all) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the nature of grace, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deigneth the knowledge even of the ſweeteſt and moſt pleaſant truths, if it apprehends a poſſibilitie of being ſaved without them. Fourthly, to cenſure the knowledge of all things as impertinent, which are not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation, is to involve the farre greateſt part of the Scriptures themſelves, (and much more of the writings of the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:112049:15"/>of men otherwiſe) in the ſame condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For who (lightly) can conceive, that the knowledge either of the Hiſtoricall, or Propheticall part of the Scriptures, is of that preciſe and indiſpenſable neceſſitie to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we ſpeake of? Nay it is evident from that paſſage in the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. that the Goſpell written by this Evangeliſt alone, is ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and conſequently that the reſt of the Scriptures are not of that auſtere and ſtrict neceſſitie thereunto. <hi>But theſe things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt in this place) <hi>that ye might beleeve, that Ieſus is the Chriſt the Sonne of God, and that beleeving, ye might have life through his Name.</hi> Fiftly, as to attempt to be <hi>wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that which is written,</hi> is preſumption and offenſive unto GOD on the one hand; ſo not to attempt, or deſire to be <hi>wiſe up to that which is written,</hi> is (as AUGUSTINE ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where termes it) damnable unthankfulneſſe, and every whit as much (if not more) diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto GOD, on the other hand. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no piece of divine inſpiration, but is too ſacred and precious, to be offered up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſervice of ſloathfulneſſe and contempt. Sixtly (and laſtly to this particular) if things were duly examined and compared together, I beleeve it would be found, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge even of thoſe things which are not of ſo abſolute a neceſſitie to ſalvation, is of greater conſequence, and more to be deſired
<pb facs="tcp:112049:15"/>in it ſelfe, then ſalvation it ſelfe; at leaſt then ſalvation, conſidered only as the good and benefit of the creature. As to generous huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the game is ever more then the prey; the nature and quality of the exerciſe more deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then the Veniſon: ſo to diſpoſitions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently ſpirituall and heavenly, that <hi>myſtery of the will of God</hi> (as the Goſpell is ſomewhere called) the wonderfull cariages and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of that profound and glorious project of his by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to bring about their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is more precious and of ſweeter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation (at leaſt ought to be both to them and others) then that ſalvation it ſelfe which they attaine by it, eſpecially if it be look'd upon, as their own concernment only. It is the ſaying of <hi>Calvin: that the glory of God alone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vua Dei gloria preferri meretur centum mundu.</hi> Calvin.</note> 
               <hi>deſerv's to be preferred before an hundred worlds.</hi> Now there is no ſuch riſe or advantage for the ſoule to glorifie GOD, as the cleere and full knowledge of him in his <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It is not the ſalvation of his creature ſimply, but this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as effected and wrought about by the way of JESUS CHRIST, that is the firſt borne of all the diſcoveries and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of the fulneſſe of GOD. Againe</p>
            <p>Fiftly, to vindicate the innocencie of the Treatiſe yet further from the crimes of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe and impertinencie, it is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that as ignorance, error, and miſtake in any one point of the Goſpell whatſoever, though it ſeemes farre remote from any
<pb facs="tcp:112049:16"/>thing which we call fundamentall, yet do they diſpoſe more or leſſe, unto apoſtacie and abſolute unbeliefe: ſo on the other hand, a cleere and ſound and comprehenſive under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any one cariage or paſſage of the Goſpell according to the Scriptures, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much towards the ſetling and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart and ſoule in a firme beliefe and confidence of the whole. The truth is, that the body and frame of the Goſpell is ſo compacted, ſo neerly related in the ſeverall parts and paſſages of it, one thing looking with that favourable and full aſpect upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, all things ſet in that methodicall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a rationall connexion, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall dependance one upon another, that if a man be maſter in his judgment of any one paſſage thereof, he may by the light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination hereof rectifie his thoughts other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and worke himſelfe on to a cleere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, and upright underſtanding of other things. Therefore a thorough and full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of any one point of the Goſpell, is of precious conſequence and uſe. But</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the weightineſſe and high impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſubject of the diſcourſe pleads the uſefulneſſe and concernment of it with an high hand. For what can be of a more rich and ſolemne concernment to a man, then cleerely to ſee, and fully and ſatisfyingly to underſtand from the Scriptures, how, and by what meanes and upon what termes, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:112049:16"/>is or is to be <hi>Juſtifyed</hi> in the ſight of God? Doubtleſſe the proſpect of the promiſed Land from Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> was not more ſatisfactory and pleaſing unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> then a cleere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the Counſell and good pleaſure of God touching the juſtification of a ſinner, is to the ſoule and conſcience of him, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hopes, or deſires to be juſtified. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſearch and inquire into this with all poſſible exactneſſe, cannot ſeeme needleſſe to any man, that ſavours never ſo little the things of his own peace. Add we</p>
            <p>Seventhly (in further proſecution of the ſame plea) that there is no veyne in all the body of the Goſpell, no point whatſoever in Chriſtian Religion, more tender, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the leaſt variation from the truth and mind of GOD may endanger the ſoule, then this of Juſtification. An haires breadth of miſtake in this, is more to be feared, then a broad error in other points. The truth is, that if a man be of a ſound and cleere judgement in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification, and ſhall ſo continue, he may finde a way into life through the midſt of many errors and miſtakes in other Articles and arguments of Chriſtian Religion: but if he ſtumbles or enterfires with the counſell of <hi>God</hi> about his juſtification, he is in danger of periſhing for ever; neither will the cleereſt knowledge of all other myſteries relieve him. <hi>Behold, I Paul ſay unto you, that if you be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing. Gal.</hi> 5.2.
<pb facs="tcp:112049:17"/>A ſmall addition (we ſee) to the Counſell of <hi>God</hi> for our juſtification, may cauſe our <hi>part to be taken away out of the Booke of life.</hi> If an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in other points of Religion, as about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reprobation, freewill, diſcipline, or the like, be to be redeemed with thouſands, doubtleſſe an error in juſtification is to be redeemed with thouſands of thouſands. In ſo much that all poſſible exactneſſe and diligence in penſiculation of Scriptures and reaſons and arguments, to lay this corner ſtone aright in the building of our Faith, may rather ſeeme negligence and looſeneſſe, then any impertinencie or ſuperfluitie of labour. And though I have no commiſſion from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to judge that opinion, touching the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts active obedience, which I oppoſe in the enſuing Treatiſe, to be inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the favour of <hi>God,</hi> and acceptation unto life and ſalvation: yet in the bowells of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> I humbly and heartily, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly beſeech all thoſe that build their comfort and peace upon that foundation, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider and lay to heart theſe 4 things, which I ſhall very briefly mention, deſiring their reſpective inlargments, rather in the ſoules and conſciences of thoſe, whom they ſo neerly concerne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the bridg of Juſtification, by which men muſt paſſe and be conveyed over from death unto life, is very narrow (as hath, in effect, bin ſaid already) ſo that an heedleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:112049:17"/>or careleſſe ſtep, may be the miſcariage and loſſe of the precious ſoule for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that to promiſe our ſelves juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and life in any other way, or upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other termes, then upon the expreſſe word and will of God revealed, is to build upon a ſandy foundation, and may and ought to be abhorred and trembled at by us, as the firſt-borne of preſumptions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly (and with neerer relation to the great buſineſſe in hand) that to ſeeke juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Law, is by the determination and ſentence of Scripture it ſelfe, no leſſe then an aboliſhing from Chriſt, or a rendring of Chriſt of none effect to ſalvation. <hi>Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of none effect unto you</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law;</hi> that is, that ſeek or promiſe unto your ſelves juſtification by the works of the Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) that that diſtinction which you commonly make, between the Law or workes of the Law, as performed by your ſelves, and as performed by another (meaning CHRIST) to ſalve the danger (as you conceive) of your being juſtified by the Law, is but a deviſe of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at the beſt, and no where warranted, much leſſe neceſſitated unto, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and conſequently, muſt needs be a dangerous principle or notion, to hazard the everlaſting eſtate and condition of your ſoules upon. I have in the Diſcourſe it
<pb facs="tcp:112049:18"/>ſelfe, and that more then once, demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the inſufficiencie and danger of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and withall ſhewed, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe no where aſcribe the Juſtification of a ſinner to the works of the Law, no not as performed by Chriſt himſelfe, but only unto his death and ſufferings. Therefore I content my ſelfe heere only to mention it.</p>
            <p>Eightly and laſtly, the uſefulneſſe of the Diſcourſe will abundantly appeare in this. The opening and through Diſcuſſion of that great and noble Queſtion therein handled, concerning the Active and Paſſive obedience of Chriſt, in Juſtification, hath an influence into many other great and maſter veynes and paſſages of the Goſpell, and tends much to the rectifying and cleering of our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in theſe. The difference betweene the two Covenants, the communication of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne to his Poſteritie, and the equity of Gods proceedings in making the world ſubject unto death and condemnation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the conſideration in Faith which makes it juſtifying, the non imputability of the works of the Law to the non-performers of them, the neceſſitie of Chriſts death, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereby we ſtand formally juſt before God, with many other particulars of ſweet and precious conſideration, will receive much light and cleering and confirmation hereby. So that to charge the Treatiſe with fruitleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or impertinencie, is an accuſation fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:112049:18"/>by the ſame line of equitie and truth whereby <hi>Joſeph</hi> was accuſed of incontinencie by his Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>I have only the fourth and laſt (and indeed the leaſt and lighteſt) imputation of unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſſe to wipe off: and then (I truſt) the Diſcourſe will be innocent. The trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome workings of the times, the labouring both of Church and State as it were in the fire (for the preſent) will (I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) be pleaded by many, as repugnant and much diſſuaſive to the publication of ſuch a piece as this: This offence (I hope) will be thoroughly healed, by theſe and the like le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitives.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the publication of it (at leaſt of part of it) was intended, whileſt all things were yet in peace amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the mother cannot chuſe her time wherein ſhe ſhall bring forth, or the child be borne, but muſt be content with the time which God and nature have appointed her, though it be in never ſo many reſpects unſeaſonable for her: ſo neither had I liberty to carve an opportunity to my own minde &amp; liking for the putting forth of this piece, but was by a ſpeciall hand of neceſſitie and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence caſt upon this ſeaſon, ſuch as it is, My time, was ſome yeares ſince: but Gods time (it ſeemes) was not till now.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When a man is fallen into a kennel, and become all mirie and durty thereby, it is not
<pb facs="tcp:112049:19"/>unſeaſonable for him to take the firſt oppori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he can meet with, to waſh and make himſelfe cleane. In like manner when he is dangerouſly wounded, there is no place for ſcanning opportunities or fitneſſes of ſeaſons wherein to be healed. Thoſe numberleſſe baſe reproaches, and forged cavillations and ſlanders under which I have a long time ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red far and neere (yea and yet ſuffer daily, not only in City and Country, but in Kingdome and Kingdome, yea aſwell beyond the Seas, as on this ſide; are (I conceive) in the judgment of all reaſonable men, an authentique diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation unto me, to neglect curioſitie of times or ſeaſons for my vindication.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, nor do I conceive what ill aſpect ſuch a ſubject as this can have upon the times, or affaires of the Church or State de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending. Thoſe that are Intereſſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation of theſe, have (doubtleſſe) both their hearts and their heads and their hands full of imployment otherwiſe, and during the time of theſe ingagements, will have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle liſt or leyſure to traverſe writings of this nature. Or if they ſhould, I know not what antipathie the Doctrine here maintained, ſhould have either to the prudent, or peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able compoſure of our troubles. Nay,</p>
            <p>Fiftly, certaine I am, that if the Doctrine of Juſtification, that is, the opening of the dore of life and ſalvation unto men, be more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable at one time then another, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb facs="tcp:112049:19"/>lyes for times of troubles, and dangers, of feares and diſtractions in the world. When can it be of deeper and deerer concernment to the ſoule, to ſee (with <hi>Stephen</hi>) the Heavens open, then when the <hi>earthly houſe of this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> (as the Apoſtles metaphor is) begins to be ſhaken, and is ready to fall, as it was with <hi>Stephen,</hi> when he ſaw that viſion?</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the fitteſt ſeaſon for a calme and quiet debating of matters in controverſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween parties engaged, is, when both parties are involv'd in the ſame condition of danger or trouble. The Martyrs in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> daies being together in priſon, argued their differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in points of Religion, as Election, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, &amp;c. with more meekneſſe, moderation, and mutual equanimitie, then in al likelyhood they would have done in fullneſſe of peace and liberty on both ſides. Wee have many examples in Hiſtory, where a common enemy proved a mediator between thoſe, that were at variance before; yea and were like ſo to have continued, had not the attonement bin made by a way or meanes diſpleaſing to both, I meane by a danger threatening both.</p>
            <p>Seventhly (and laſtly) to ſupport ſo great and important a truth of the Goſpell, as that contended for in the Diſcourſe, is by a faire interpretation, a meanes farre more likely to advance both the peace and ſafety of Church and State, and to heale the ſores and troubles of both, then any waies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb facs="tcp:112049:20"/>or ſet back the cure. It is much to be feared, that among many other grounds and cauſes of that ſore controverſie, which God is at this day (and hath bin ſome yeares paſt) pleading with the land and his people in it, theſe three have done their parts, and help'd forward the diſpleaſure. Firſt, that thoſe to whom God hath graciouſly revealed himſelfe amongſt us, and withall endued with guifts and abilities for ſuch a purpoſe, have raiſ'd the line of Evangelicall knowledg among us ſo little, above what was delivered unto us by our firſt Reformers. We have done little elſe with that talent of Goſpell-light, which God at firſt gave us as a ſtock to ſet up and Trade withall for him, but only put in a Napkin. We have ſcarce added an haires breadth to our ſtature in the knowledg of Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a cubit at leaſt, might well be expected from us.</p>
            <p>Secondly (that which is worſe and of more provocation, then the former) by our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſymbolizing with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that ignoble Principle of hers, ſo diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Heauen, <hi>to beleeve as the Church belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> we ſwallow down many of thoſe miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and miſtakes in matter of Religion, which were found in our firſt Reformers, and teach them for Doctrines and Orthodox truths. As if it were not lawfull to thinke that there may be more light in the aire when the Sunne is riſen in his might upon the earth,
<pb facs="tcp:112049:20"/>then there was at the firſt dawning and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, and that which is more unworthy the Name of Chriſtians then either of the former; we have quite loſt (as it were) and let fall amongſt us many precious truths and ſtreynes of the Goſpell, which God by the hand of the former generation, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed over to us, and entruſted us withall. An inſtance whereof may be that very point of truth, which is ſo copiouſly handled and defended in this Treatiſe, and withall ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated to have bin delivered unto us, by <hi>Luther, Calvan, Muſculus,</hi> and other worthies of that band. Now that ſuch a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and ſinfull deportment of a Church or people towards God as this, is a juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his breaking out in wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, may be gathered from <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Hold that faſt, which thou haſt</hi> (ſaith the Lord Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) <hi>that no man take thy Crowne:</hi> implying, that either the looſe-holding, but eſpecially the letting goe of any Goſpell truth, which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Church hath had in cuſtodie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, indangers the Crown of it, that is, the peace, ſafety and continuance of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to endeavour to keepe an ancient truth alive, which was ready to die amongſt us, is rather a meanes to eaſe and lighten the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of that guilt which lieth upon us, and conſequently to turne away, or to abate the
<pb facs="tcp:112049:21"/>diſpleaſure of God, and ſo to further the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Land, then any waies to increaſe or ſoment the troubles of it. And thus much more then enough by way of Apologie.</p>
            <p>I have only two things to require of thee (good Reader) by way of courteſie, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Diſcourſe, which I hope will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thee for them; though they be both faire, and equall to be granted, even without demand, &amp; much more without recompence. Firſt, in caſe thou meeteſt with the ſame ſenſe or ſubſtance of matter, cloathed with differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t expreſſions; one or ſome whereof thou canſt well beare and underſtand, others being more hard and offenſive unto thee (which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive may be a caſe frequently incident in the peruſall hereof) my requeſt is, that thou wilt reduce that which ſeems crooked, to that which is ſtreight, and make an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the better for the worſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas one and the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or aſſertion in words, may admit of different explications and meanings, in the one whereof it may be true, and accordingly either affirmed or granted by me; in another falſe, and ſo by me denyed; my requeſt in this place is, that thou wilt not judge me a man of contradictions, though in one place I denie that aſſertion in words, which in another I affirme or grant, but that thou wilt relieve me in ſuch paſſages and reconcile me to my ſelfe, by the mediation of mine owne diſtinctions
<pb facs="tcp:112049:21"/>and particular explications of my ſelfe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. I give thee notice in one place,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Part. 2. c. 3. ſoct. 9. p. 57.</note> that there is ſcarce any propoſition can be framed, wherein the word, <hi>impute</hi> or <hi>imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is uſed indefinitly and without ſpeciall limitation and explication, but may both be granted and denied, according to a different ſenſe and acceptation thereof. And who knoweth not, but that aſſertions and ſayings otherwiſe, are very frequently thus conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Now to grant a propoſition in one ſenſe, and to deny it in another, is ſo farre from being contradictions, that it can hardly be avoyded in any cloſe reaſoning upon any theme or ſubject whatſoever. But for the greateſt part of ambiguities incident to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters diſcuſſed in the ſubſequent Treatiſe, I explaine my ſelfe and mine own apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in two places chiefly, <hi>viz.</hi> in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Part, but eſpecially in the third of the ſecond.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall pleaſe publiquely to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and write againſt what is here publiſhed, I have two requeſts to make unto him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Firſt, that he will bend the maine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſtrength of his diſcourſe againſt the maine of mine; and not brouze or nibble upon ſome twiggs, or outward branches, but ſtrike at the root or maine body of the tree, or at leaſt at ſome of the principall arms and limbs thereof. A tree may ſtand firme, and be choyce timber, and yet the ſmaller boughs
<pb facs="tcp:112049:22"/>and branches thereof being tender, eaſily broken. It is no damage or prejudice to a Diſcourſe, though ſome ſentences or expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be pick'd out here and there, which being ſeparated from their trunck or ſtemme wherein they grow, ſeeme weak, and very capable of oppoſition.</p>
            <p>My other requeſt to ſuch a man is, that hee will pleaſe to interdict his pen all paſſionate language and expreſſion, and returne no worſe meaſure in this kinde, then is here mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured unto him. Truth is not to be drawne out of the pit where ſhe lieth hid, by a long line of calumnies, reproaches, and perſonall aſperſions upon him who is ſuppoſed to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her: but by the golden chaine of ſolid demonſtrations, and cloſe inferences from the Scriptures. The readieſt way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her, is to follow after her in love. When men are fierce and fiery in their diſputes, it is much to be feared, that they want the truth, or at leaſt the cleere and comprehenſive knowledge of the truth, to coole and qualifie them.</p>
            <p>I take little notice in the enſuing Treatiſe of that paſſionate piece of Diſcourſe lately publiſhed, and ſtyled by the Author. <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme Diſcovered and confuted;</hi> a title better fitting the work, then the Author was aware of, or intended. For herein he diſcovers So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſme in his own opinion; and then croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and confuteth it, when he hath done.
<pb facs="tcp:112049:22"/>This I have made appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ant in the Anſwere to part of that Diſcourſe which I ſent unto him, and which ſince hath bin thought meet (it ſeem's) to ſome, to be made more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. In conſideration whereof, as likewiſe by the adviſe of ſome friends otherwiſe, I tooke off my pen, and ſuſpended the finiſhing of a full and particular Anſwere to that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (which I began immediatly upon the publiſhing thereof) after I had made ſome conſiderable progreſſe therein. As upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I deſiſted, ſo upon advice I may be brought on againe to perfect and publiſh thoſe beginnings, In this Treatiſe, I no where trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the reſt and peace of Mr. <hi>Walkers Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> but only in the fourth Chapter of the ſecond Part: nor here doe I meddle with any other particular thereof, but only with that, which is the heart and ſoule (ſuch as it is) of that whole diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> his delineati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or deſcription of the whole Doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>I have detained thee ſomewhat long in the entrance: but thou ſeeſt there was cauſe. I deſire now to open the door unto thee, which leadeth into the Diſcourſe it ſelfe, by earneſt prayer &amp; addreſſement of my heart and ſoule unto God on thy behalfe, that he will give thee a ſpirit of diſcerning, a ſound and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and unpartiall judgement in all things, that thou mayſt call no man Maſter on Earth, but reſerve the glory and honour of this
<pb facs="tcp:112049:23"/>Name whole end entire, for thy great Maſter in Heaven: that he will ſo bleſſe and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Diſcourſe unto thee, that in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, it may poure thee out a bleſſing of knowledge for thine underſtanding, of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment for thy judgement, of peace for thy conſcience, of joy and gladneſſe for thine heart and ſoule, and all this and much more through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by whom he is able to doe it, to whom be everlaſting confeſſions and acknowledgements of all Grace and Glory, and every excellencie, by every Creature AMEN.</p>

As for the Phyſical ſenſe of making juſt by inherent righteouſneſſe, though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his Angells, earneſtly contend for it, yet till Scriptures be brought low, and <hi>Etymologies</hi> be exalted above them, till uſe and cuſtome of ſpeaking deliver up their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into Cardinalls bands, that ſenſe muſt no way be acknowledged or received in this diſpute: Yet (to give reaſon and right, even to thoſe that demand that which is unreaſonable) it is true, that <hi>God</hi> in or upon a mans <hi>juſtification,</hi> begins to juſtifie him Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically, that is, to infuſe habituall or inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe

               <p>Concerning the other ſenſe of a judiciary juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation uſually and ſtrictly ſo called, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>2</label> wherein the Iudge or juſtifier proceeds upon legall grounds to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit and abſolve the party guilty or accuſed, neither can this be taken in the Queſtion propounded, except the Scriptures be forſaken, becauſe the Scriptures conſtantly ſpeake of this act of <hi>God</hi> juſtifying a ſinner, not as of ſuch an act whereby he will either make him or pronounce him legally juſt, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him not to have offended the Law, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon juſtifie him; but of ſuch an act, whereby he freely forgives him all that he hath done againſt the Law, and acquits him from all blame and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due by the Law unto ſuch offences. So that in that very act of <hi>God</hi> whereby he juſtifies a ſinner, as there is a diſcharge from all puniſhment due unto him, ſo there is a profeſſion withall, or plaine inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the guiltineſſe of the perſon now to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified according to the Law, and that he is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged or acquitted upon any conſideration that can be pleaded for him according to the Law, but that conſideration upon which <hi>God</hi> proceeds to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, is of another order; the conſideration of ſomewhat done for him in this caſe to relieve him out of the courſe and order or appointment of the Law, he whoſe juſtification ſtands (whether in whole or in part, it is not materiall herein) in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinne, can in no conſtruction be ſaid to be juſtified according to the Law, becauſe the Law knowes no forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, neither is there any rule for any ſuch thing there. The Law ſpeakes of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112049:32"/>the <hi>curſe, death,</hi> and <hi>condemnation</hi> of a <hi>ſinner;</hi> but for the <hi>juſtification</hi> of a <hi>ſinner,</hi> it neither takes knowledg, nor gives any hope thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the naturall Sonne of <hi>God,</hi> and ſupernaturall Sonne of the Virgin, ran a race of obedience with the Law (aſwell Ceremoniall as Morall) and held out with every letter, jot, and tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it, as farre as it any wayes concerned him, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole continuance of his life in the fleſh, no mans thoughts ever roſe up to deny, but thoſe that denyed him the beſt of his being (I meane his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head) <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſinne?</hi> was his challenge to the Nation of the Jewes whilſt he was yet on earth (<hi>Ioh</hi> 8, 46.) and remaines through all ages as a challenge to the world. He that can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſt the leaſt aſperſion or imputation of ſinne upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhall ſhake the foundations of the peace and ſafety of the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that this <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered up himſelfe as a Lambe without ſpot in ſacrifice upon the Croſſe to make an attonement for the world, and to purge the ſinne of it, I know no ſpirit at this day abroad in the Chriſtian world that denies, but that which wrought in <hi>Secinus</hi> formerly, and ſtill workes in thoſe that are baptized into the ſame ſpirit of error with him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I conceive it to be a truth of greater authority amongſt us, then to meet with contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from any man, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is the ſole and entire meritorious cauſe of every mans juſtification, that is juſtified by <hi>God;</hi> or that that righteouſneſſe or abſolution from ſinne and condemnation which is given to every man in his juſtification, is ſomewhat, yea a principall part or member of that great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made for the world. <hi>Evan as God for Chriſts ſake freely forgave you. Epheſ.</hi> 4.32. Forgiveneſſe of ſinnes or juſtification is from <hi>God</hi> for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112049:32"/>
                  <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake; he is worthy to be gratified and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>God,</hi> with the juſtification of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, whatſoever he is worthy of more.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It is a truth that hath every mans judgment concurring with it, that Faith is the condition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>God,</hi> and required on mans part to bring him into Communion and fellowſhip of that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and redemption which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the Children of men, and that without belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, no man can have part or fellowſhip in that great and bleſſed buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, It is evident from the Scriptures, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that <hi>God</hi> in the act of every mans juſtification doth impute or account righteouſneſſe unto him, or rather ſomwhat for or inſtead of a righteouſneſſe (the Scripture uſeth both expreſſions) by meanes of which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation the perſon juſtified paſſeth in accompt as a righteous man (though he be not properly or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſuch according to the Law) and is inveſted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly with thoſe great priviledges of a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous, deliverance from death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and acceptation into the favor of <hi>God.</hi> The reaſon of which imputation, or why <hi>God</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to uſe ſuch an expreſſion of righteouſneſſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in or about the juſtification of a ſinner ſeemes to be this; the better to ſatiſfie the naturall ſcruple of the weake and feeble conſciences of men, who can hardly conceive or thinke of a juſtification or of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified (eſpecially by <hi>God</hi>) without an expreſſe, literall, and perfect legall righteouſneſſe. Now the counſailes and purpoſe of <hi>God</hi> in the Goſpell being to juſtifie men without any ſuch righteouſneſſe (being a righteouſneſſe indeed whereof man in his lapſed condition, is wholly uncapable) <hi>the better to ſalve the feares of the conſciences</hi> touching ſuch a defect, and to prevent and ſtay all troubleſome thoughts or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112049:33"/>queries that might ariſe in the minds of men, who when they heare of being juſtified, are ſtill ready to aske within themſelves, but where is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? conceiving a legall righteouſneſſe to be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a juſtification, as <hi>Iſaak</hi> conceived of a Lamb for a burnt offering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22, 7.) He (GOD I meane) is graciouſly pleaſed ſo far to condiſcend to men in Scripture treatie with them about the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty buſineſſe of juſtification, as (in effect) to grant and ſay unto them, that though he finds not any proper or perfect righteouſneſſe in them, no ſuch righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe as paſſeth under the name of a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with them, yet if they truely believe in him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, this believing ſhall in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, be as good, as a perfect or compleate righteouſneſſe unto them, or that he will impute righteouſneſſe unto them upon their believing.</p>
               <p>So that now the ſtate &amp; drift of the Q. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>3</label> is not either 1, whether Faith without an Object, or as ſeparated from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be imputed for righteouſneſſe, for ſuch a Faith (doubtleſſe) in the point of <hi>juſtification</hi> was never dreamt of by any man that kept his wits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: men may aſwell fancy a living man without a Soule; or a wiſeman without his wits, as a Faith without an Object: much leſſe was ever ſuch a faith conceived by any to be imputed for righteouſneſſe. Neither 2, is it any part of the intent of the Queſtion to enquire, whether <hi>Faith</hi> be the meritorious cauſe of a mans <hi>juſtification,</hi> for both they that affirme, and they that deny the imputation of <hi>Faith</hi> for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deny the meritoriouſneſſe of <hi>faith</hi> every waies: however it is true, that they that would ſeem moſt to diſclaime it, and caſt it furtheſt from them, do yet in ſome of their moſt beloved tenets draw very neare unto it (as will afterward appeare) Neither 3, is it the Queſtion, whether <hi>Faith</hi> be the formall cauſe of

And this manner of ſpeech, to put the name of a thing in the proprietie of it, inſtead
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112049:36"/>of the valew, worth, benefit or returne of it, is both uſuall and familiar, in ordinary paſſage of diſcourſe amongſt us, and very frequent in the Scriptures.

So when we ſay ſuch a man grew rich by his place or Office, our meaning plainly is but this, that he grew rich by ſuch gaines or matters of profit as his place or Office afforded him; we do not meane, that his place or Office it ſelf was his riches. So may it be ſaid, that we are juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet not have the righteouſneſſe it ſelfe upon us by imputation or otherwiſe, but only a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe procured or purchaſed by it, really and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally differing from it, <hi>viz.</hi> remiſſion of ſinnes (as will appeare in due time.)</p>
               <p>Thus in the Scriptures themſelves, there is no figure or forme of ſpeech more frequent, then to name the thing it ſelfe in the propriety of it, in ſtead of the fruite or effect of it, good or bad, benefit or loſſe, vantage or diſadvantage, merit, or demerit of it.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Job</hi> 33, 26. <hi>God is ſaid to render unto man his righteouſneſſe,</hi> i.

Apparent it is to a circumſpect Reader, that the Apoſtle's maine intent and drift in this whole diſcourſe of <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (extending from the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to ſome Chapters following) was to hedg up with thornes (as it were) that falſe way of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> which lay through works and legall performances, and ſo to put men by from ſo much as attempting to goe or ſeek that way: and withall to open and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the true way of <hi>juſtification,</hi> wherein men might not faile to atteyne the Law of righteouſneſſe (as he ſpeaks elſewhere) before God: that is (in plaine ſpeech (to make known unto them what they muſt doe, and what God requireth of them, to their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and what he will accept at their hands this way, and what not.

So that that which God preciſely requires of men to their <hi>juſtification,</hi> inſtead of the workes of the Law, is FAITH, or to beleeve (in the proper and formall ſignification) He doth not require of us the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for our <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> this he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe for it, that which he requires of us for this purpoſe, is our <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> himſelfe, not in the righteouſnes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, in the active obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (as hereafter is ſhewed). There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for <hi>Paul</hi> to have certified or ſaid unto men, that the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be imputed for righteouſneſſe unto them, had been quite beſide his ſcope and purpoſe in this place, which was plainly and directly this (as hath been ſaid) to make known unto men, the counſel and good pleaſure of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that which was to be performed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (though not by their owne ſtrength) to their <hi>juſtification,</hi> which he affirmeth from place to place, to be nothing elſe, but their <hi>Faith,</hi> or beleeving. To have ſaid thus unto them, that they muſt be juſtified by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or by <hi>Chriſt's</hi> righteouſneſſe, and withall not to have plainly ſignified, what it is that <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them, to give them part and fellowſhip in that righteouſneſſe, or juſtification which is by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and without which they could not be juſtified, had bin rather to caſt a ſnare upon them, then to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a dore of life and peace unto them.

               </p>
               <p>Now how importune, and impertinent to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne had it beene for him to interpoſe a whole Chapter only to prove that, which was never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of nor queſtioned by any? To wit, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did well in believing <hi>God,</hi> and was approved by him for it. His buſineſſe here was not to argue what was lawfull, and what was unlawfull, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtifiable in his act of believing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112049:42"/>
                  <hi>God.</hi> But to demonſtrate and ſhew, how and by what meanes a poore miſerable ſinner, might come to be juſtified, and accounted righteous before <hi>God,</hi> which he clearly and fully demonſtrates to be by way of <hi>Faith</hi> or beleeving, from the example of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> whoſe <hi>faith</hi> was by <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, imputed for righteouſneſſe unto him, that is, upon and by the meanes of his <hi>Faith</hi> he was looked upon by <hi>God</hi> as a righteous man. But the conceit againſt which we now argue, is too weake to beare any great waight of confutation.</p>
               <p>If that yet ſtickes with any man, that <hi>Abraham</hi> having believed formerly (as appeares from his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory) and thereby juſtifyed, ſhould be ſaid to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by a ſecond, or after act or believing. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere 1. Be it granted that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, and was thereby juſtified before that act of beleeving, whereunto this Teſtimony is ſubjoyn'd, that it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15, 6) yet doth it not follow, that this teſtimony ſhould be preciſely limited to, or only underſtood of that particular act of his believing, whereunto it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, but it may indifferently relate as well to the firſt as the laſt act of his believing, (yea happily ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the firſt then to the laſt) for it is not ſaid (in the place cited) that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed the Lord in this particular promiſe now made or renewed unto him, but indefinitely, and in the generall, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> believed or had believed the <hi>Lord,</hi> and it was imputed, or accounted unto him for righteouſneſſe. So that howſoever <hi>Abraham</hi> was preciſely juſtified by the firſt act of a ſound <hi>Faith,</hi> which ever he put forth, yet the teſtimony or record of his <hi>juſtification</hi> by beleeving might be ſuſpended by the Holy Ghoſt, till his <hi>Faith</hi> became more conſpicuous, and was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:112049:42"/>manifeſted. Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 4. the teſtimony of <hi>Abels</hi> righteouſneſſe by <hi>Faith,</hi> was (as it ſeemes) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, till the manifeſtation of his <hi>Faith,</hi> by offering ſuch a ſacrifice unto <hi>God</hi> as he did: whereas it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought, but that he was a righteous or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſon, and that by meanes of his <hi>Faith,</hi> before the offering of that ſacrifice. So that this Objection, is eaſily anſwered.</p>
               <p>Beſides further anſwere might be, that the intent of the Holy Ghoſt in this teſtimony and paſſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not to ſhew the time when, but the manner or meanes how and whereby he was juſtified. Now all ſucceeding acts of juſtifying <hi>Faith</hi> as juſtifying (for there are many acts of a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Faith,</hi> which are not of that kind of act, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> juſtifieth) being of the ſame kind and nature with that primary and firſt act of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, whereby he was juſtified, may in ſufficient propriety of ſpeech have the effect of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as well to them, as it is to the firſt act it ſelfe. As ſuppoſe a man hath beene a true beleever in God through Jeſus Chriſt for ſeven yeares together, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſpace he hath conſtantly every day renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or repeated the very ſame act of believing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was at the firſt of a ſinner made righteous, this mans <hi>Iuſtification</hi> or making righteous, may accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the frequent tenor of Scripture language, be aſwel aſcribed to any of theſe after acts of believing, as to the firſt of all, it being uſuall with Scripture to aſcribe effects, though not really and actually effected and done, to ſuch meanes or actions of men, which are apt to produce and effect them.

But one principall reaſon, why it ſhould not be numbred or reckoned up amongſt the objects of Faith as juſtifying, may (with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) be conceived to be this: becauſe, though it ought to be, and cannot but be beleeved by that <hi>Faith,</hi> which juſtifieth, yet it may be beleeved alſo by ſuch a Faith, which is ſo far from juſtifying, that it denyeth this <hi>Chriſt</hi> (whoſe righteouſneſſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it beleeveth and acknowledgeth) to be the Son of <hi>God.</hi> Thus ſome of his owne Nation the Jewes, have given teſtimony to his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and innocency, who yet received him not for their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> nor believed him to be <hi>God.</hi> And this is the frame and conſtitution of the Turkiſh Faith (for the moſt part) concerning him at this day.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>6</label> that <hi>Faith</hi> which is here ſaid to be <hi>imputed unto Abraham for righteouſneſſe,</hi> ver. 3. is that Faith by which he beleeved in God, that quickeneth the dead, and calleth the things that are not as if they were, ver. 17. But the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> can in no tolerable conſtruction, or congruitie; of ſpeech, be called that Faith, by which <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved in God that quickeneth the dead &amp;c. Therefore the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not that Faith, that is here ſaid to be imputed for righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that Faith which was imputed unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for righteouſneſſe ver. 3. is that Faith, wherein
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:112049:45"/>it is ſaid ver. 19. that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not weak, and is oppoſed, to doubting of the promiſe of God through unbeliefe, ver. 20. But the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be conceived to be that, wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> was not weake, neither doth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> carrie any oppoſition with it, to a doubting of the promiſe of God through unbeliefe, being a thing of a differing kind and nature from it. But betweene Faith properly taken or a firme belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and a doubting through unbeliefe, there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect &amp; perfect oppoſition. Therefore it is Faith in this ſenſe, and not the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is ſaid to be imputed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Sevently, that Faith which was imputed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſſe, was that Faith, by which he was fully aſſured, that he which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, was able alſo to doe it (for thus it is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, ver. 21.) and the imputation of <hi>faith</hi> ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, is plainly affirmed ver. 22. and therefore it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſſe. But the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not capable of any ſuch defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or deſcription, as this, that by it <hi>Abraham</hi> was fully aſſured, that he that had promiſed, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo able to performe it. Therefore the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not that, that was imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, that which ſhall be imputed unto us for righteouſneſſe, is ſaid to be our beleeving on him, that raiſed up the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> from the dead. v. 24. But the righteouſnes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not our belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him that raiſed up our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> from the dead. Therefore it cannot be that, that is either ſaid or meant to be imputed unto us for righteouſnes.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, (and laſtly) whereas the queſtion or point of imputation in <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> is handled only in this paſſage of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. (for thoſe other
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112049:45"/>places <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, and <hi>Iam.</hi> 2, only mention it, but inſiſt not at all upon any declaration or explication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) it is no waies probable, but that the Apoſtle ſhould ſpeake ſomewhat diſtinctly and plainely of the nature of it here. Otherwiſe he might ſeeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſirous to have layd a ſtumbling block in the way of men; then written any thing for their learning and comfort. If we take the word FAITH or BELEEVING, ſo often uſed in this Chapter, in the proper and plaine ſignification of it, for that Faith whereby a man beleeves in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the promiſe of <hi>God</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then the tenor of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is as cleare as the day, and full of light: the ſtreame of the whole Chapter run's limpid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled. But if we bring in a tropicall and metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall interpretation, and by Faith, will needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to meane the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we cloath the Sun with a Sackcloath, and turne <hi>Pauls</hi> perſpicuitie into a greater obſcuritie, then any light in the Scripture knoweth well how to comfort or relieve. The word FAITH, being a terme frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in the Scripture, is yet never found to ſignifie the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt never putting this word into that ſheath: neither is there any, either rule in Grammar, or figure in Rhetorique, that know's how to ſalve up the inconſiſtencie of ſuch an interpretation. <label type="milestone">

               <p>If it be objected and ſaid, that <hi>faith</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſometimes put for the object of <hi>faith,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 23. But before Faith came (that is, the Doctrine of Faith, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe the object of Faith) we were kept under the Law. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 1, 22. <hi>He preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the faith, which ſometimes he deſtroyed. &amp;c.</hi> and may be ſo uſed with as good proprietie of ſpeech, as hope is put for the thing or things hoped for (which is an expreſſion not unuſuall in the Scriptures.)</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:112049:46"/>
               <p>To this I anſwere, firſt, by conceſſion, that true it is, the name of the faculty is ſometimes put for the object appropriated to it: neither is there any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or cauſe of offence or miſtake in ſuch an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It rather add's grace &amp; comlineſſe to the ſentence wherein it is uſed, if it be uſed ſeaſonably, as might be exemplified by ſeverall Scripture inſtances, (if it were pertinent).</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, by way of oppoſition I anſwere, Firſt, though the faculty be ſometimes put for the Object, yet the act ſeldome (or never) to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. The actor exerciſe of the grace of hope, is never put for the things hoped for, but <hi>hope</hi> it ſelfe is ſometimes found in that ſignification. As <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1, 5. <hi>for the hope which is layed up for you in the Heaven.</hi> So Tit. 2, 13. <hi>Looking for that bleſſed hope, &amp;c.</hi> Now that which is here ſaid to be imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſſe, was not the habit or grace of his Faith, but <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved <hi>God</hi> (that is, exerciſed or put forth an act of Faith, &amp; it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto him for righteouſnes. So that though <hi>faith</hi> may be ſometimes put for the object of Faith, yet the exerciſe of this <hi>Faith,</hi> or to <hi>believe,</hi> is never put for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though it ſhould be granted, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the act it ſelfe, as the faculty or habit, may be ſometimes put for the Object, yet when the act and Object have been named together, and the act ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and ſpecified by an Object proper to it, and further, ſomewhat immediatly aſcribed to this act under that conſideration (all which is plainly ſeene in this clauſe, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto him for righteouſneſſe)</hi> in this caſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or affirme, that what is ſo aſcribed, is neither aſcribed unto the act it ſelfe there mentioned (which is here, <hi>Abrahams beleeving)</hi> nor unto the Object mentioned likewiſe with it (which is here, GOD:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:112049:46"/>
                  <hi>Abraham beleeved God)</hi> but to ſome third thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally differing from them both, and not ſo much as once mentioned or named in all the diſcourſe (as the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not once named through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this whole Chapter, no nor in any other Chapter neere at hand, either antecedent, or ſubſequent) what is this but to turne a mans back upon the text, to looke out an interpretation? and to exchange that which is plainly affirmed, with what is not ſo much as obſcurely intimated or implied? and to make the Apoſtle ſpeake as man never ſpake beſides, not for wiſdome or excellencie of ſpeech, but for the uncouth abſtruſeneſſe of his meaning? Doubtles no inſtance is to be found of any Author whatſoever, ſacred or prophane, who ſo far abhorred to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in what he ſpake, as to put his minde into words of ſuch a conſtruction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, to the Objection I Anſwere: that neither is the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the object of <hi>Faith,</hi> as juſtifying (as hath been ſaid, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently made good) nor doth the Scripture, where it ſpeakes of <hi>Faith</hi> as juſtifying (which places are not a few) make the leaſt mention, or give the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſuch a thing. It is true, the Scriptures ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times propound the righteouſnes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, as that which is to be beleeved, &amp; ſo it may be termed a partiall object of <hi>Faith,</hi> that is, ſomewhat that is &amp; ought to be believed: but ſo the creation of the world is propounded to be beleeved, and that <hi>Cain</hi> was <hi>Adams</hi> Son, is ſomewhat to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved. And generally whatſoever the Scriptures do affirme, may be called a partiall object of <hi>Faith.</hi> But the object of <hi>faith</hi> properly, as it juſtifieth, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, or the promiſe of GOD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Redemption and ſalvation of the world by him. The righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no more the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:112049:47"/>object of <hi>Faith</hi> as juſtifying, then either his being borne of a Virgin, or his aſcending up into Heaven, or the like, and either the one or the other, may (in that reſpect) be aſwell here ſaid to be imputed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſſe, as the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Thus you ſee at large how many paſſages and circumſtances in the context, ſtand up in conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation againſt that expoſition, which by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Faith</hi> in this Chapter, will needs underſtand <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>9</label> (and laſtly) this interpretation we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for: according to which, the word <hi>Faith</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, is to be taken properly in all the paſſages mentioned, and not tropically or metonymically) was the common interpretation anciently received and followed by the principall lights, (I meane the Fathers) of the Church of God from the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, and for 1500 yeares together (as far as my reading and memorie together will aſſiſt me,) was never queſtioned or contradicted. Neither did the contrary opinion ever looke out into the world (at leaſt was never contended for) till the yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of the laſt age. So that it is but a calumnie or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill report, brought upon the opinion, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Scripture which we maintaine <hi>(unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the tongue or pen of any learned and ſober man)</hi> to make either <hi>Arminius</hi> or <hi>Socinus,</hi> the Authors or founders of either. And for this laſt hundreth yeeres and upwards, from about <hi>Luthers</hi> and <hi>Calvins</hi> times, the faireſt ſtreame of Interpreters ſo runs, as to water and refreſh the ſame interpretation. You will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily inclin'd (I preſume) to beleeve both the one and the other, that both former and latter times have been friends and favourers of the interpretation given, if you will pleaſe, with diligence and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, to ponder and examine theſe few te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:112049:53"/>ſhould have done had there been a continuance in the firſt Covenant? Therefore this righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be imputed to any man, for that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, whereby he is to be juſtified.</p>
               <p>Neither will theſe and the like Scriptures be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by words of any ſuch gloſſe or interpretation as this: No man ſhall be juſtified in the ſight of God by the works of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> as perſonally wrought by themſelves, becauſe no mans works will hold out weight and meaſure with the ſtrictneſſe and perfection of the Law. But this hinders not, but that a man may be juſtified by the works of the Law, as wrought by another, ſuppoſing this other to be as great in working or obeying as the Law it ſelfe is in commanding, and withall, that <hi>God</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to derive theſe works of his upon us by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

               <p>Secondly I anſwere, that if the Apoſtles charge and commiſſion had bin, <label type="milestone">

Doubtleſſe <hi>Paul</hi> was no ſuch enemy to the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as to ſet up an uſurper upon the Throne, which belonged to it.

               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) if by excluding the works of the Law from <hi>juſtification, Pauls</hi> meaning had been, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>4</label> only to exclude theſe works as done by men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but had no intent to exclude them as don by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it can at no hand be thought, or once imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that he would have made uſe, yea made much of ſuch a diſtinction or reſervation himſelfe, and would have been a glad man, if <hi>ſalva veritate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelij,</hi> without trenching upon ſome Goſpel truth, he could have come over ſo neere to his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the Jewes, and have cloſed with them in the great point of <hi>juſtification</hi> upon ſuch terms. Such a diſtinction might have been a happy mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. For what was it that chiefly incenſed the Jewes againſt <hi>Paul</hi> and the Preaching of the Goſpell and the righteouſneſſe of Faith, but that the Law and the obſervation of it, ſhould be paſſed over and not taken into the great buſineſſe of <hi>juſtification.</hi> Now if <hi>Paul</hi> keeping a ſtreight courſe in the Goſpel, could have ſaid unto them, or treated with them after any ſuch manner as this: you have no reaſon to take offence or to be troubled, that I preach <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> by Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe I do not exclude the righteouſneſſe or works of your Law, no not from having the maine ſtroke in your <hi>juſtification:</hi> nay that which I preach concerning Faith, is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to advance the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:112049:55"/>to ſhew you how you may be juſtified by it. I only Preach, you cannot be juſtified by your owne obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, becauſe the holineſſe, excellency and perfection of it is ſuch, that you cannot attaine or reach it by your owne ſtrength: but <hi>God</hi> hath ſent me to keep it for you, by whoſe obſervation <hi>imputed</hi> to you, you ſhall be juſtified. Therefore I am no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to your <hi>juſtification</hi> by the works of the <hi>Law:</hi> but only teach you, that theſe works are done by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for your <hi>juſtification.</hi> Who ſeeth not, but by ſuch an interpretation or mitigation of matters as this, <hi>Paul</hi> might have taken off, (at leaſt) a great part of the violent and furious oppoſitions of the <hi>Iewes</hi> againſt him? A little of this oyle poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wound, would have much mollified it, and (in all likelyhood) in time have healed it. But <hi>Paul</hi> (it ſeemes) did not like the compoſition or make of it, neither durſt he adminiſter any receite of it. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to have bin ignorant of this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or meanes of mitigation, and with as little proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie can it be thought, that he, that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, not only to be made all things unto all men for their good, but even to have been an <hi>anathema</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to win them to the Goſpel, would have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held any ſuch word of reconciliation from them, whereby there had been the leaſt hope of gaining them. But we do not meet with ſo much as any one word of this qualification in all his writings: which ſhewes that the difference and diſtance betweene them, was deeper and greater then ſo. The parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſme or ſharpe contention betweene him and them, was not, whether they were to be juſtified by the works of the Law, either as performed and wrought by themſelves, or as wrought by another, but ſimply and indefinitly this, whether <hi>juſtification</hi> were by the works of the Law (by whomſoever performed) or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:112049:55"/>by Faith (as is more then manifeſt in all the paſſages in his Epiſtles, wherein this queſtion and diſpute is brought upon the ſtage) There is not the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of any difference betweene them this way, whether <hi>juſtification</hi> ſhould be by the works of the Law, either as performed by our ſelves, or as perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Chriſt: Paul</hi> never puts them upon the works of the Law as done by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the matter of their <hi>juſtification:</hi> which ſhewes, that both he and they, though otherwiſe at as great a diſtance as can readily be conceived in the point of <hi>juſtification,</hi> yet in this were both of one mind and one judgment. <hi>Paul</hi> as far from holding <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by the works of the Law as performed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves were.</p>
               <p>But there are two things that (haply,) <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>5</label> may be objected againſt the Anſwers given, and that will ſeeme to make for the confirmation of that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or interpretation, which we have ſo much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Firſt, that there is a ſufficient ground laied even by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, upon which to found the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named diſtinction, viz. that by excluding the works of the Law from <hi>Juſtification,</hi> he only excludes them, as done by men themſelves, but not at all as done by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, that there is mention alſo of the works of the Law, as done by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or (which is the ſame) of <hi>Chriſts</hi> being made under the Law, in one of the chiefeſt diſputes <hi>Paul</hi> hath concerning <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi> The former objection is built upon <hi>Tit.</hi> 3, 5. The latter, upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p>The words of the former Scripture, are theiſe: <hi>Not by the workes of righteouſneſſe, which we had done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us.</hi> Vpon which words the objection getteth up thus: <hi>Paul</hi> by ſo preciſe a rejection of works of righteouſneſſe done by us, that is, by our ſelves, plainly implies an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:112049:56"/>of theſe works as done by another for us. Where one part or member of a diſtinction is given, the oppoſite member being implied, is ſtill to be framed to it (as readily it may). Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> had no intent to ſhut out, but to bring in the works of the Law (as wrought by <hi>Chriſt</hi>) into the buſineſſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwere ſundry things: Firſt, that the active obedience or righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be wholly excluded, and be made a ſtander-by, ſo as to have nothing at all to do in the great buſineſſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> this diſcourſe hath no where affirmed hitherto, neither doth it ſavor any where of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that affirmation. It hath been expreſſely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged from the beginning, to have a gracious and bleſſed influence thereinto as it iſſueth and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into his paſſive obedience, which together may be called a righteouſneſſe for which, but at no hand, with which, we are juſtified. Therefore this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, contending and pleading for an admiſſion of the workes of the Law, as done by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> into <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> doth no waies contradict the anſwere given in any part of it, except it can prove the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this admiſſion of the active righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either for the materiall, or formall, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> which it no waies doth, nor pretendeth to do. And the truth is, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall doe it, that is, goe about to make this righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> either the formall, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or inſtrumentall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> will be found upon a due examination, wholly to diſſolve and overthrow the merit of it: the eſtabliſhment whereof is yet pretended as the great and pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of that opinion.</p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwore, that the inference inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the objection from the Scripture mentioned,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:112049:56"/>comes heavily and with much unwillingneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation out of the premiſſes: there is no neceſſitie, nor indeed ſo much as a face of probabilitie in it. The Holy Ghoſt may reject the works of men from being the cauſe of ſuch or ſuch a thing, and yet no waies ſuppoſe or intimate that the works of another ſhould be the cauſe thereof. As when we deny ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Faith or works of any man foreſeene to be the cauſe of his election, we do not imply that the Faith or works of <hi>Chriſt</hi> foreſeene are the cauſe of ſuch election. No more doth it follow, that becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> rejects the works of righteouſneſſe which men do, from their <hi>juſtification,</hi> that therefore he muſt needs imply a ſubſtitution of the workes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their ſtead. If the words had gone thus, <hi>Not by the workes of righteouſneſſe which we</hi> OUR SELVES <hi>had done,</hi> this had beene ſomewhat a higher ground, and a more rationall advantage to have infer'd the oppoſite member of the diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> but by the works of another, or of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 24. where <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth himſelfe thus, <hi>Neither is my life deare unto my ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> here the oppoſite member of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion may with good probability be conceived to be implied, after this manner: <hi>my life is not deare unto my ſelfe,</hi> THOUGH IT MAY BE DEERE UNTO O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERS. And yet even ſuch an intimation here, is not of abſolute neceſſitie neither. But if the tenor of the words had only run thus, <hi>Neither is my life deere unto me, ſo that I may fulfill my courſe with joy:</hi> No man would ever have dream't or thought of any further thing to be implied, then what was expreſſed. So when the Holy Ghoſt in a direct and plaine tenor of Speech ſpeaketh only thus: Not by the workes of righteouſneſſe which we had wrought (not which we our ſelves had wrought) for men to conclude or inferre, an implying of workes wrought by another,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:112049:57"/>is (in plaine and neceſſary interpretation) to make themſelves wiſe above that which is written:</p>
               <p>But thirdly, (to put the matter out of all queſtion) that excluding the works of the Law which we had done, he had no intent, by way of oppoſition to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the works which another might doe, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth plainly the oppoſition himſelfe, and tells us that it was <hi>according to his mercy</hi> that he ſaved us, not by the works of righteouſneſſe which we had done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us: Therefore here can be nothing implied by way of oppoſition, becauſe the oppoſition is fully and diſtinctly ſet downe. And</p>
               <p>Fourthly, leaſt any might yet ſay, that it may be according to <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, and yet by the works of righteouſneſſe wrought by <hi>Chriſt</hi> too, theſe two may eaſily be reconciled and ſtand together: the Apoſtle delivers himſelfe diſtinctly of that wherein this mercy of <hi>God</hi> he ſpeaks of, conſiſteth, not in ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, by the works of <hi>Chriſt</hi> imputed to us, but in regenerating of us, and waſhing us in the new birth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly (and laſtly) as ſuch an inference is no waies neceſſarie, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>6</label> nor ſo much as probable, ſo is it no waies pertinent to the purpoſe for which it is ſo earneſtly contended for, though it ſhould be granted. Becauſe it is evident that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here rejects the workes of righteouſneſſe which he names, from being any cauſes antecedaneouſly moving <hi>God</hi> to ſave us, and not from being the formall cauſe of <hi>juſtification.</hi> So then let us give the objection its owne hearts deſire, even that it murmur's ſo much after, <hi>viz.</hi> that the works of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt of neceſſity be here implied, yet will it periſh and come to nothing, even whilſt this meat is in the mouth of it. For all that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or can be concluded by the imaginary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſuch a ſuppoſition is only that whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:112049:57"/>will be aſhamed when it is brought forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>viz.</hi> this, that it is not the works of the Law which we have done our ſelves, but thoſe which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done, that have moved God to ſave us by the waſhing of the new birth, and by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. Which if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and meant of the decree and purpoſe of <hi>God</hi> ſo to ſave us, is againſt the truth: if it be underſtood of the execution of this decree, is againſt themſelves. For that which moved <hi>God</hi> to decree or intend this ſalvation unto us, was nothing out of himſelfe, but that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that good and gracious pleaſure of his will. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. or as that clauſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) that that will, wherewith <hi>God</hi> willeth and purpoſeth to ſave his people, is intirely his owne, borne and begotten (as it were) only out of himſelfe, without the ſeed of any conſideration of any thing whatſoever, out of himſelfe. As for the execution of this decree in the actuall <hi>juſtification</hi> or regeneration of thoſe whom he hath purpoſed to ſave, if this be aſcribed to the works of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe done by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the cauſe moving <hi>God</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, this cleerely eſtabliſheth the <hi>merit</hi> of the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>juſtification,</hi> but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the formality of it (which is that very truth, which this diſcourſe ſeeketh and enſueth) for if <hi>God</hi> juſtifieth or regenerates for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which imports the merit thereof) he cannot either juſtify or regenerate with this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the formall cauſe of either: the Reaſon is, becauſe it is unpoſſible, that one and the ſelfe ſame thing in reſpect of one and the ſelfe ſame effect, ſhould put on the different habitude or
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:112049:58"/>conſideration both of the formall and efficient cauſe. Wherefore if the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> (as all muſt grant that will acknowledg it for a meritorious cauſe thereof, no man gainſaying but that the meriting cauſe is a ſpecies or kind of efficient) unpoſſible it is that it ſhould be brought in to any part or fellowſhip in the formall cauſe thereof, as will further be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when we come to lay downe our grounds and reaſons for what we hold.

               <p>For Anſwere hereunto (not to inſiſt againe upon that which was delivered in the firſt branch of my Anſwere to the former objection, which yet is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to eaſe the point in Queſtion of the burden of this objection) I ad this in the firſt place: that the phraſe of <hi>Chriſts</hi> being made under the Law, doth not ſignify <hi>Chriſts</hi> obedience or ſubjection to the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> or that part of the Law which we call <hi>Morall,</hi> but rather his ſubjection to the Law <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,</hi> as is evident from the ſcope of the place: and particularly, from that which is delivered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly (ver. 5.) as the end or intent of that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made under the Law, <hi>viz. that he might redeeme them that were under the Law.</hi> There is no reaſon to conceive that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be ſaid to be made under any other Law, then that, from under which he was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:112049:58"/>to redeeme others. Wherefore we being not redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> or from that obedience due to that (that being <hi>lex aeterna, &amp; aeternae obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> an eternall <hi>Law,</hi> and of an eternall obligation) but from the Law of Ceremonies, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it was this Law, under which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is here ſaid to have been made. So that if men will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anything from hence, for the imputation of <hi>Chriſts</hi> obedience in juſt ſication, it muſt be of that obedience which he performed to the Jewiſh or Ceremoniall Law, and ſo not only the Jewes, but we of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, muſt be cloathed with the robes of a Ceremoniall righteouſneſſe imputed unto us for our <hi>Iuſtification.</hi>

It is a paſſage (I conceive) carried by ſome ſuch rule as this, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath in the following Chapter, ver. 4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies:</hi> Now becauſe theſe <hi>Philipians</hi> were under great trialls and afflictions, and ſo might think it was no time for them to rejoyce in, and that <hi>Paul</hi> had forgotten himſelfe, and the condition they were in, to ſpeake to them of rejoycing, therefore to ſhew that he knew well enough what he ſaid, and that he had weighed his words ſufficiently, before he put them downe, and that there was no other cauſe but why they ſhould rejoyce in the Lord, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fiery triall that was upon them, he redoubles the words of his exhortation. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies, and againe I ſay rejoyce.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> here, having once affirmed, that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> wherein he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be found, was the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which is by the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to have ſpoken that which he would not ſtand to, or that which he would upon ſecond thoughts retract, he ſpeakes the ſame words (in effect) the ſecond time, and avouceth that very <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which is by <hi>Faith,</hi> to be that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> that he would ſtand to, and deſired to be found with. If <hi>Paul</hi> had had any mind or inclination at all, to have placed the righteouſneſſe by which he was to be juſtified, in the <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt imputed,</hi> here was even a tempting occaſion and opportunity to have drawne him into expreſſions of himſelfe that way.

               <p>It may be it will be here ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>2</label> that they which confeſſe that <hi>Faith juſtifieth,</hi> doe not meane or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it, as divided or ſevered from it's object, CHRIST. No more did ever any man that had but the firſt fruits of reaſon given him for his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For a man to ſay, that he ſeeth, and yet to affirme, that when he ſeeth, he ſeeth nothing, is to profeſſe open enmitie againſt common ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Neither is it any other in him (whoſoever he be) that ſhall conceive of any act of <hi>Faith,</hi> that is not exerciſed or acted upon its object, either <hi>Chriſt</hi> in perſon, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> in promiſe, or the like. It is unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any man ſhould beleeve, but that he muſt beleeve ſomething, or in ſome perſon: and ſo when any man ſpeakes of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>beleeving,</hi> he muſt of neceſſity imply the object with, or in the Act,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:112049:70"/>though he names only the Act, and not the object, as the uſuall manner of the Scripture expreſſion is, where <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>beleeving</hi> is 40 times mentioned, without addition of the object <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the promiſe of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or any thing equivalent to either.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be it will be ſaid, that when men profeſſe and ſay, that <hi>Faith iuſtifieth,</hi> their meaning only is, that <hi>Faith juſtifieth,</hi> inſtrumental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not otherwiſe. To this I anſwere, neither hath any thing more bin ſaid hitherto by me, neither is any thing intended to be ſaid in the ſequel, but according to the rule of this poſition: <hi>Faith juſtifieth.</hi> inſtrumentally.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, it may be it will be yet further obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>3</label> that when men confeſſe that <hi>Faith iuſtifieth,</hi> their meaning is, that it <hi>Iuſtifieth,</hi> as it takes hold of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe.</hi> I Anſwere, if this alſo ſhould be granted (but the Scripture, as hath bin ſaid, never mentioneth or deſcribeth <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith</hi> under any ſuch conſideration) yet it is the act of <hi>Faith</hi> that <hi>Iuſtifieth.</hi> As when a man put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth his arme, and reacheth a pot or cup with drink in it, wherewith he quencheth his thirſt, he may be ſaid to quench his thirſt inſtrumentally, by reaching out his arme; becauſe this was a meanes to procure it. So let men put what meaning or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation they pleaſe upon their words, when they profeſſe and acknowledg, that it is <hi>Faith</hi> that <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,</hi> if they meane at all as they ſay they muſt meane that it is the Act of <hi>Faith</hi> that <hi>Iuſtifieth,</hi> becauſe both that <hi>Faith</hi> by which a man beleeves in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is an act of <hi>Faith,</hi> and againe, that <hi>Faith</hi> by which a man is inſtrumentally <hi>Iuſtified,</hi> is an act of <hi>Faith:</hi> and that <hi>Faith</hi> that layeth hold upon the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is an act of <hi>Faith</hi> too. Therefore let men turne themſelves any way, and which way they pleaſe,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:112049:70"/>and make their words to fall either to the North, or towards the South, if they meane as they ſay, that <hi>faith</hi> indeed <hi>Iuſtifieth,</hi> they muſt meane, that it is the act of <hi>faith</hi> that <hi>Iuſtifieth.</hi> And when themſelves will ſay that <hi>faith Iuſtifieth,</hi> and yet will condemne it for an error in another, that the act of <hi>faith</hi> ſhould <hi>Iuſtify:</hi> they cannot eſcape the hands of this <hi>dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> but one of the horns will gore them; either it muſt follow, that they doe not meane, as they ſay: or that they condemne their owne opinion and meaning in another: moſt true it is, that it is far from truth to ſay, that <hi>faith iuſtifyeth</hi> as it is an act: and as far from truth it is, to ſay, that it is not the act of <hi>faith</hi> that <hi>Iuſtifieth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be yet further replyed and ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>4</label> that when men ſay, we are <hi>juſtified</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> their meaning is, that we are juſtified by that which <hi>faith</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: and this is farre from ſaying, <hi>that Faith is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for righteouſneſſe.</hi> To this I Anſwer: 1. if their meaning be ſimply and without limitation ſo, that we are juſtified by that which <hi>Faith</hi> apprehendeth, when they ſay, we are juſtified by Faith, then they ſpeake more truth, then they are aware of, and (as it ſeems) more then they intend to ſpeake. For that Faith <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth</hi> is moſt true: but that whatſoever Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth ſhould <hi>juſtifie,</hi> hath no fellowſhip with truth, (no not ſo much as in appearance) For <hi>By Faith we underſtand</hi> (or apprehend) <hi>the worlds were made,</hi> Heb. 11.3. yet no man will ſay, that the creation of the world <hi>juſtifies</hi> men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if men aſcribe <hi>juſtification</hi> in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and conſideration to that which Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth, they utterly overthrow that which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they profeſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the inſtrumentall <hi>juſtification</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> For if any thing that <hi>faith</hi> apprehendeth, juſtifieth every way, both materially, and formally,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:112049:71"/>and meritoriouſly, and principally, and inſtrumental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp;c. Faith</hi> ſhall <hi>juſtifie</hi> no wayes: and ſo when men ſay, <hi>they are juſtified by Faith,</hi> their meaning muſt be, they are not at al <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> but by ſome other thing. Therfore of neceſſity it is, that <hi>Faith</hi> muſt <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie</hi> ſome way: if it <hi>iuſtifieth</hi> any way, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceility be, by <hi>imputation</hi> or <hi>account from God for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,</hi> becauſe it is all that <hi>God</hi> requires of men to their <hi>iuſtification,</hi> inſtead of the righteouſneſſe of the Law.

When he was deſired (<hi>Luk.</hi> 12 13.14.) to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or take up a controverſie betweene a man and his Brother, his anſwere was, <hi>Man, who made me a Judge, or divider over you?</hi> Implying, that he would meddle with no acts of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> that lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the precincts of his Calling.

So when the people would have taken him and made him King, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. he abſolutly refuſed: and refuſing the office of a King, doubtleſſe he would not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the execution.

               <p>Secondly to the objection I anſwere yet againe, that where the Scripture calleth <hi>Love</hi> the fulfi ling of the <hi>Law,</hi> it ſpeaketh only of that part of the <hi>Law,</hi> which we call the ſecond Table: as is no whit leſſe then evident in the place laſt named. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8.9. But that fulfilling of the <hi>Law,</hi> which claimes the honour of a <hi>juſtification,</hi> whether by <hi>imputation</hi> or <hi>perſonall</hi> performance, muſt comprehend as well a fulfilling of the firſt as of the ſecond Table.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, that propoſition, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> is not <hi>propoſitio ſormalis,</hi> but <hi>cauſalis &amp; conſecutiva</hi> (as <hi>Logiciaxs</hi> ſpeake) that is, ſuch a propoſition, wherein one thing is ſaid to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, not becauſe it is preciſely the ſame in nature and being with it, but becauſe it is the cauſe of it, and ſo hath the being of the other vertually in it. This kind of propoſition is frequent in Scripture. I am the reſurrection (ſaith <hi>Chriſt, Ioh.</hi> 11.25.) The
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:112049:76"/>meaning is not, that he was properly and formally the reſurrection, but that he was the cauſe, meanes, or Author, of the reſurrection. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our hope, meaneth only, <hi>that</hi> CHRIST <hi>is the ground or Author of our hope.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. In like manner, when he ſaith, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> his meaning only is, <hi>that a ſpirituall and unfeigned affection of love, is an inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that nature and importance which inclineth and diſpoſeth a man to the performance and practiſe of all manner of duties required in the Law.</hi> Therefore to ſay that the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>imputed</hi> to men for their fu filling of the <hi>Law,</hi> or for their <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> is ridiculous. More might be added by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: but the ſtrength of the Objection is ſmall.</p>
               <p>Another thing that (happily) ſome will object againſt the argument propounded, is this: <label type="milestone">

               <p>To this I Anſwere two things: Firſt, they which ſpeake ſuch things, doe not conſider the ſeverity of the letter, the ſtrict and peremptory nature of the Law. The Law will not know any <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Neither is that reaſon of any value, which ſome alledg, <label type="milestone">

Gods</hi> meaning was, that he ſhould die an eternall death (literally) and not by way of equivalencie. Therefore <hi>God</hi> having not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding inflicted this Curſe by way of equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and not in the letter of it, why may he not <hi>impute</hi> a legall <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> unto men, that hath only an equivalencie with that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> which they ſhould have performed, though not an exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with it according to the letter.</p>
               <p>For to this I anſwere: Firſt, that the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that is layed to build this objection upon, is ſandy, and hath nothing either in Scripture, or ſound reaſon to bottome it. From the Scriptures, nothing that I have read, is ſo much as pretended that way, <hi>viz</hi> that <hi>God</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death,</hi> muſt of neceſſity, preciſely and determinatly meane, <hi>eternall death,</hi> according to the <hi>letter.</hi> And by what fire, ſuch a ſpirit as this is, will be extracted or drawne out of that body of thoſe words, I doe not yet underſtand. If we judge of his intent and meaning in thoſe words by the event
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:112049:79"/>of things, or manner of execution, they were meant determinatly, neither of <hi>eternall death</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>letter,</hi> nor yet of an <hi>eternall death</hi> by way of <hi>equivalencie,</hi> but indifferently of either, becauſe it was an eternall death only by way of equivalencie that was inflicted upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> for one part of <hi>Adam</hi> or his poſterity: but upon the other part which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, it is inflicted according to the <hi>letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly upon deeper conſideration, it will (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily) be found to be neerer the truth, to hold, that in thoſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death,</hi> God his meaning was not (at leſt determinatly) to threaten eternall death either in one kind or other, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter, or by way of equivalencie: but to have the word <hi>Death,</hi> taken and underſtood by <hi>Adam,</hi> in the extent of the ſignification, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſignifieth that evill of the puniſhment which was repreſented and knowne unto him, by the name of <hi>Death,</hi> without limiting his thoughts to the conſideration either of the ſhorter continuance, or of the everlaſtingneſſe of the duration of it. For as <hi>Scotus</hi> well determines in this caſe) <hi>Aeternitas non eſt de ratione poenae peccatis debitae, ſed peccatores con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitans, qui non poſſunt ut Chriſtus, vel cum Chriſto cluctari.</hi> 1. Eternitie is not of the nature or eſſence of the puniſhment due unto ſins, but it followes and falls upon ſinners, who cannot wraſtle out as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, or with him. So then, eternity not being eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to that puniſhment or death which <hi>God</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is no waies neceſſary that it ſhould be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (eſpecially in ſuch a preciſe and determinate manner as the objection pretendeth) in the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that word, wherein the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is expreſſed.</p>
               <p>But thirdly and laſtly, ſuppoſe the foundation be gold, yet will it be found hay and ſtubble that is built upon it. For what if <hi>God</hi> ſhould take liberty to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:112049:80"/>from the letter of the Curſe, in the execution of it, ſhould threaten eternall death literally, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlict it equivalently: this no waies proveth, that the creature who was bound to obey the precepts of the Law, might take the like liberty to performe one thing inſtead of another, or that <hi>God</hi> ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any ſuch payment from them (whether made by themſelves, or by another for them,) in the nature of a legall payment. Indeed having received a full ſatisfaction for all the tranſgreſſions of the Law, he may by a ſecond or new Covenant accept of what he pleaſeth to eſtate men in the benefit or bleſſing of that ſatisfaction, and ſo that which is thus accepted, becomes in this reſpect to him that performs it and from whoſe hand it is accepted, equivalent to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleate legall <hi>righteouſneſſe:</hi> becauſe it <hi>juſtifieth</hi> him (in reſpect of all benefits and privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a <hi>juſtification</hi>) as well as ſuch a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> would have done. But that he ſhould accept on any mans behalfe, as a perfect legall <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> the performance of ſuch things, which are not required of him, neither by the firſt Covenant of works, nor by the ſecond of Grace, hath neither correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or agreement with the one Covenant, or with the other.

Now one difference betweene them is this: what any one member of the body naturall doeth, as head, eyes, eares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the whole may be ſaid to do: when the head ſtudieth, the man may be ſaid to ſtudy: So when the eye ſeeth, or eare heareth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea it is more proper to aſcribe theſe and ſuch like acts which are exerciſed by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members of the naturall body ſeverally, and the whole perſon, then to the members themſelves by which they are acted: it is more proper to ſay, the man ſeeth by the eye, then to ſay the eye ſeeth: But in the myſticall body, it is otherwiſe: When <hi>Chriſt</hi> (the Head of this body) wrought miracles, the body could not be ſaid to have wrought them. So when <hi>Paul</hi> (a ſpeciall member of this body) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Peter,</hi> the whole body cannot be ſaid to have reproved him: becauſe ſome of the members joyned with <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſinne againſt <hi>Paul</hi> in his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:112049:84"/>reproofe. The Reaſon of which difference is this, becauſe in the naturall body; the members make but one <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> (as the Schoolemen ſpeake) or one perſonall being, and ſo have but one and the ſame numericall principle of all their actions and motions, <hi>viz.</hi> the reaſonable ſoule, but a myſticall body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made up of many perſons or perſonall beings, which have every one entire natural &amp; ſubſtantial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in themſelves (beſides their relation of members one to another) and ſo have every one principles of their actions really diſtinct each from other. One mans will is not really and numerically the ſame with anothers: nor one mans grace really the ſame with anothers. And hence it cometh to paſſe, that what one of theſe members doe, is not neceſſarily to be aſcribed to the whole body, but to that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber only which doth it, inaſmuch as it hath a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within it ſelfe, which is not numerically the ſame with the reſt.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I anſwere more briefly and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the objection. Though the benefit of what the head doth, be communicated to the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and every member (for every member in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body fareth the better for the Head, and the operations of it) yet that which the head doeth or worketh, is no waies to be imputed or aſcribed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto the hand or foot, or any other member, as if it were done by them: ſo doth the whole myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and every member thereof (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the whole Societie and fellowſhip of <hi>beleevers</hi>) reape and enjoy abundantly the fruite, benefit, and bleſſing of all that <hi>Chriſt</hi> (the Head) either did, or ſuffered in the world: forgiveneſſe of ſins, peace of conſcience, acceptation into favor with <hi>God,</hi> adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſanctification, hope of glory, glory or ſalvation it ſelfe (when it cometh) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe and the like
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:112049:84"/>are Grapes gathered from that Vine; the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> or <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his whole body with all theſe precious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant riches: and yet there is no neceſſity that either his doings or ſufferings ſhould be aſcribed or <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> unto them, no more then the labor and skill of the Bee, is to be aſcribed unto him that eates the honey. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Againe, ſome urge the conſideration of the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age betweene <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, every <hi>beleever</hi>) to ſalve the congruity or ſitneſſe of his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> for <hi>imputation</hi> to <hi>beleevers:</hi> and reaſon after this manner. <hi>The wife by mariage, hath a right to all that is her Husbands:</hi> ſhe is endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all his goods: they are aſwell hers, as his. Therefore a <hi>beleever</hi> being maried to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath a right and title to all that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath, all that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath is his: and therefore his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> is his. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Anſwere two things. Firſt, it is true, the wife by mariage comes to be endowed with all that is her Husbands: but this endowing of her with all, is no ingredient into the mariage it ſelfe (much leſſe is it the formall cauſe of the mariage) but is a fruite or conſequent of it. So the right and title which a <hi>beleever</hi> hath to the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> accrues unto him by, and upon the ſpirituall mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. The mariage muſt be firſt made up betweene <hi>Chriſt</hi> and him (which is done by <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>beleeving</hi>) before he comes to have this right ſpoken of in the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therefore it cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pured unto him in the very act of <hi>beleeving</hi> (which is the golden apple the adverſe opinion ſtrives for) and yet much leſſe before the act of <hi>beleeving</hi> (which yet is affirmed by ſome great and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rned abettors of that ſide) Becauſe in both theſe caſes, the title we ſpeake of to the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:112049:85"/>not grow to a <hi>beleever,</hi> by, or from, or upon his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but either in, or before it.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I anſwere yet further (and cloſe more neerely with the ſpirit of the objection) How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever by mariage there ariſeth a title unto the wife of all that is her Husbands, ſo that it may be ſayd, that all that is the Husbands, is made or becomes the wifes: yet this is ſo to be qualified and underſtood, that no Law either of naturall decencie and ſobriety, or of a rationall expediencie or behoofe to either party, receive prejudice or violation. All that is the Husbands, is not every waies the wifes by meanes of her mariage, nor for every uſe or purpoſe, but only in a way of expediencie or beneficialneſſe to her. As for inſtance: the cloaths or garments of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, are the wifes by mariage: but how? not hers to put on, and weare upon her owne perſon, for ſo they would be hers to her owne ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. We know it was prohibited in the <hi>Law. Deut.</hi> 22.5. <hi>The woman ſhall not weare that which perteyneth unto the man, for all that doe ſo are an abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto the Lord thy God.</hi> But hers they are, (and may be called hers) in this ſenſe, as it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and credit unto her that her Husband be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed like himſelfe, and that his habit be according to his rank and quality. So is it indeed an unſpeakable comfort, and a ground of a glorious rejoycing unto a beleeving Soule, that her Lord and Huſband <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> is cloathed with that rich and glorious robe of <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> that he is ſo <hi>holy,</hi> ſo <hi>harmleſse,</hi> ſo far <hi>ſeparate from ſinners, as he is:</hi> but ſhe muſt take heed of aſſuming theſe things unto her ſelfe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then in the benefit and comfort of them: ſhe muſt not thinke her ſelfe as holy, as harmleſſe, as far ſeparate from ſinners, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe is. The Common or inferior <hi>Prieſt</hi> that ſhould put on and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:112049:85"/>ſerve in the High Prieſts garments, was by the Jewes adjudged guilty of death, by the hand of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> citeth out of <hi>Maimony</hi> upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.43. So againe, the wiſdome and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Husband, may be ſaid to be the wifes, by mariage. But how? not for her to be wiſe withall, for in this reſpect it is her Husbands only, notwithſtanding mariage: the woman is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as wiſe as her Husband, becauſe the Husbands wiſdome is hers by mariage: but it is hers in the benefit and comfort of it, thus: having a Husband that is wiſe, ſhe ſhall live the better, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life with him, ſhe ſhal be the better provided for, and the like. So the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ours by right of our ſpirituall mariage with him: but not to be <hi>righteous</hi> withall (formally) for this is ſtill his perſonall propriety, notwithſtanding the giving of himſelfe in mariage to us: but to have the benefit and bleſſing of communicated unto us, and derived upon us, both in our <hi>juſtification, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation.</hi>

He that is compleatly <hi>juſtified</hi> by having his ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, is <hi>juſtified</hi> without the <hi>imputation</hi> of this <hi>active obedience</hi> or <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This propoſition is generally granted: for no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for this <hi>imputation</hi> (in the ſenſe we ſpeake of) in regard of forgiveneſſe of ſins (neither is there any colour for it) but for another purpoſe, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. Therefore I aſſume: But a <hi>beleever</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:112049:86"/>is ſuthciently <hi>juſtified</hi> before <hi>God</hi> by the forgiveneſſe of his ſins: therefore I conclude: There is no need of this <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> for <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> The latter propoſition, that men are fully <hi>juſtified</hi> before <hi>God</hi> by having their ſins pardoned, hath been already proved at large (cap. 5.) by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe teſtimonies of the Scripture: whereunto we found the judgment of <hi>Calvin</hi> (with other learned <hi>Divines</hi> of the reſormed Religion) fully conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Here we obſerved, that to <hi>juſtifie</hi> in Scripture dialect, conſtantly ſignifies, abſolution from guilt and puniſhment, but never any qualifying or inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a poſitive or legall <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> either by <hi>imputation,</hi> or otherwiſe. To thoſe Scriptures, which were there produced and inſiſted upon (being many) yet many more might be added of like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, there being no ſtreame of truth running fuller or cleerer along the Scriptures then this. But becauſe we ſhall have aſſiſtance enough from thoſe very places alledged, to vindicate the interpretation given againſt all that is, or can be objected againſt it, we will ſpare that time and labor.</p>
               <p>But againſt the Expoſition given of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein it was affirmed, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>2</label> that the Scriptures know no other <hi>juſtification</hi> of a ſinner, but that which ſtands in remiſſion of ſinnes, or diſcharge from the puniſhment or condemnation due unto them, it is objected: <hi>that forgiveneſſe of ſins is indeed a part of juſtification but not the whole: imputation of</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe <hi>muſt be likewiſe added.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwere: Firſt, that <hi>Calvin</hi> is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely of another judgment as words can make him: a profeſſed enemie to this biformed or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>juſtification.</hi> On Rom. 4. ver. 6, 7. &amp;c. he hath theſe words. <hi>Quibus etiam verbis docemur, juſtitiam Paulo nihil aliud eſſe, quam remiſſionem peccatorum.</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:112049:87"/>i. in which words we are taught, that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> (with <hi>Paul</hi>) is nothing elſe but remiſſion of ſins. He doth not ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> placeth <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> or <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> partly in remiſſion of ſins, partly in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe: but plainely affirmes, that that <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse</hi> by which we are <hi>juſtified</hi> or made <hi>righteous</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God,</hi> is NOTHING ELSE but this forgiveneſſe. Againe, in his <hi>Inſtitutions.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 11. ſect. 21. <hi>Iuſtitia fidei eſt reconciliatio cum Deo, quae</hi> SOLA RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISSIONE PECCATORUM <hi>conſtat.</hi> The <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is our reconciliation with <hi>God,</hi> which conſiſts of remiſſion of ſins ONLY.</p>
               <p>Againe in the ſame Section: <hi>Conſtat, quos Deus amplectitur,</hi> NON ALITER <hi>fieri juſtos, niſi quòd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſis peccatorum remiſſione maculis purificentur, ut talis juſtitia</hi> VNO VBRBO <hi>appellari queat</hi> REMISSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>O PECCATORUM i. It is evident, that thoſe whom <hi>God</hi> embraceth, are NO OTHER-WAIES made <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> but becauſe they are purifyed, having their ſpots waſhed off by the forgiveneſſe of ſins: ſo that this <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> may IN ONE VVORD, be called, REMISSION OF SINNES. Againe in the following Section. <hi>Sic remiſſionem peccatorum cum juſtitiá connectit Apoſtolus, Act.</hi> 13.38. <hi>ut</hi> IDEM PROR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS <hi>eſſe oſtendat.</hi> i. The <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Act. 13.38. doth ſo couple or conjoyne forgiveneſſe of ſins with <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> that he plainely ſhewes them to be AB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLVTELY, OR ALTOGETHER THE SAME. Again, in the third Section of the ſame Chapter. <hi>Cum (Scriptura) dicit Deum juſtificare impium quieſt ex ſide Chriſti, quis ſenſus eſse poteſt, niſi fideibeneficio a damnatione liberare, quam ipſorum impietas mereba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur?

When the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, that God juſtifieth the wicked, that is of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:112049:87"/>the Faith of Jeſus, what elſe can be meant, then the freeing or abſolving him from that condemnation by the benefit of his Faith, which his ſin deſerved. And a little after (in the ſame Section) To juſtifie therefore is nothing elſe, then to abſolve a man from guilt, as one of approved innocencie, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed as one guiltie. Yet once more: in the ſame Chapter. Sect. 15. <hi>Hic eſt fidei ſenſus, &amp;c. quòd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedente Chriſti juſtitiâ, impetratâ remiſſione peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, juſtificatus ſit.</hi> 1. This is the meaning of a mans Faith, &amp;c. that by the mediation or interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, he is juſtified by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins obtained. Laftly in the fourth Sect. of the ſame Chapter. <hi>Quarto autem capite ad Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, &amp;c. i.</hi> In the fourth Chapter to the Romans, he firſt calls (juſtification) the imputation of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and doubteth not to place it in REMISSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON OF SINS.

               <p>Notwithſtanding a great Maſter of the oppoſite way in this controverſie, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>3</label> being loath to loſe a man of ſuch authority as <hi>Calvin</hi> is, from his partie, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts yet by force to bring him through all this fire and water over to him: and therefore pretends to finde more ingenuitie in <hi>Papiſts</hi> and in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe towards this Author, then in men of his owne profeſſion (<hi>Proteſtants</hi> I meane) that are of an oppoſite judgment to him in this point. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (ſaith he) doth confeſſe and acknowledg, that though <hi>Calvin</hi> doth againe and againe place <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in remiſſion of ſinnes only, yet he holds <hi>imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> too. To this I anſwere:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that which is here called ingenuity in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> I fully conceive to be nothing elſe, but a peece of Jeſuiticall cunning, to make his adverſaries opinion the more irrationall, that ſo he might have the more advantage againſt him in diſputation: which will further appeare by and by.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceive, that as <hi>Paul</hi> in Chriſtian wiſdome pleaded his <hi>Phariſaiſme,</hi> when time was, to helpe himſelfe at a pinch, though otherwiſe hee little regarded it: or as <hi>Sampſon</hi> tooke up the jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of an Aſſe, to revenge himſelfe of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and threw it away when he had done: ſo this man findesingenuity in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> to quit himſelfe in a ſtrcight, ſeaſt <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhould be taken from him, and to avenge himſelfe of his adverſaries in this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but otherwiſe cares little for it.</p>
               <p>But thirdly (and laſtly) if either <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> or his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:112049:88"/>interpreters (who finds this miracle of ingenuity in him) meaning be, that <hi>Calvin</hi> holds the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> neceſlary to <hi>juſtification,</hi> by way of merit only, we are no further adverſaries in this point: But if their meaning be (and other it cannot be without apparant prevarication) that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and beſides remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Calvin</hi> holds a neceſſity of the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſse</hi> in <hi>juſtification,</hi> as a ſecond part or member of it (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtinct from remiſſion of ſins) to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate and perfect, this is to burthen <hi>Calvin</hi> with ſuch an <hi>imputation,</hi> as is not lightly incident to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering and learned man, as he was. He himſelfe in his <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt the <hi>Counſell of Trent,</hi> in their ſixt Seſſion, takes thoſe Fathers tardie with that Logicall Soloeciſme in their Divinitie, of making the formall cauſe of <hi>juſtification</hi> double, <hi>acſi partìm remiſſione pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum, partim ſpirituali regeneratione juſti eſsemus. i.</hi> as if we were righteous partly by remiſſion of ſins, partly by ſpirituall regeneration. Now if he ſhould place <hi>juſtification</hi> partly in remiſſion of ſinnes, partly in the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe:</hi> who ſeeth not that himſelfe is in the ſame condemnation with his adverſaries, and builds up by example, what he pulls downe by reproofe?

From whence obſerve, firſt, that to place <hi>iuſtification</hi> in <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins alone, was an opinion by it ſelfe, diſtinct from the other, that held <hi>iuſtification</hi> by the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> alone. For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the disjunctive particles in this Canon, that the Councell, being (as it ſeems) good Husbands of their thunderbolts, had an intent to ſtrike down two opinions at once. And ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (as we heard) explains the Councell. Secondly, obſerve (that which follows cloſe upon the former obſervation) that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was ſuch an opinion then ruling in the Reformed Churches, or at leaſt taught and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome eminent man (one, or more) amongſt them, that held <hi>iuſtification</hi> to conſiſt in Remiſſion of ſins <hi>onely:</hi> otherwiſe thoſe deep-adviſed ſages of the Councel, ſhould have but put a dead ſlie into their box of oyntment, by boltring into the ayre: and indeed, rather have forged a weapon for their adverſaries, then taken any from them. If it were any particular and eminent man, they ſtruck at, as an abettor of that opinion, there can none be pitched upon with greater probability then <hi>Calvin,</hi> who ſtill carried matters of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:112049:90"/>Religion againſt them at that time with a higher hand then any other. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (as we heard) inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſſed, <hi>Calvin</hi> by name to be the man. Thirdly (and laſtly) from this paſſage obſerve, how ſome mens either learning or memory miſuſeth them, by ſuggeſting to them, that the opinion pleaded and contended for in this Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> or (which is the ſame) that <hi>iuſtification ſtands in Remiſſion of ſins onely,</hi> is an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confederate with Popiſh errors. Certainly thoſe great Agents and Factors for the Roman party, would never have bin ſo farte overſeene in their ſolemn and ſacred aſſembly, to have poured out the vials of their wrath upon the head of an opinion, that was their owne.</p>
               <p>The importune ſtriving and contendings of ſome men to make <hi>Galvin</hi> for them, in an opinion, wherof (doubtleſſe) his learning was never guilty, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled us to make ſomewhat the longer labour and diſcourſe of it, for his reſcue, and to ſet him cleere upon his own principles and foundations. If any man remains yet unſatisfied touching this Authors judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the point now under examination, and deſires rather an heape, then enough: it were an eaſie matter to make the pyle of teſtimonies from his own pen yet farre greater, even to the wearying and puniſhing of ſuch a man with his own deſire. Somewhat more then hath bin here delivered, may be found in the firſt Chapter: where alſo you may ſee this worthy Champion of the truth, accompanied and ſeconded in this ſervice, with many of his fellows not much inferiour to him. And this bv way of Anſwere in the firſt place to the objection, <hi>that Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>6</label> 
                  <hi>was not the whole, but only a part of our Iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I Anſwer, that from the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that were alledged, it may be evidenced, as by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:112049:91"/>expreſſe demonſtration, that there is no more, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part or member of <hi>iuſtification,</hi> but onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſins: that the nature and ſubſtance of it is fully comprehended in this. What can be more pregnant then that <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 6, 7. &amp;c. <hi>Even as David alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſſe of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe without works:</hi> ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſinnes are covered: Bleſſed is the man, to whom the Lord will not impute ſinne.</hi> If there were any thing more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which is by <hi>imputation,</hi> then only the forgiveneſſe of iniquity, or the covering of ſin, would the Holy Ghoſt wholly have omitted it and left it out, when he intended a <hi>deſcription,</hi> or <hi>declaration</hi> if it? Eſpecially would he have omitted, that which is the maine and principall and formall part of it, as the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed</hi> is pretended to be? If a man ſhould prefix ſuch a Title as this before a Book, or over the head of a Mappe, <hi>A deſcription of the world,</hi> &amp;c. and never ſo much in all his Book or Mappe, as once mention <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> the chiefe parts of the world, but onely ſome obſcure and leſſer Countries, would it not argue, that either he wanted wit himſelfe, or elſe hoped that his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would want it altogether? Or if a Limner ſhould be ſet on worke to draw a mans picture or portraicture, and ſhould only draw the trunk of his body, without a face or head upon it, were this the portraicture or deſcription of a man? No more would <hi>Paul</hi> (or rather the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) have called the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes, a <hi>deſcription</hi> or <hi>declaration</hi> of the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which is <hi>imputed</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> if it had bin only a part, and that the leſſer and leſſe materiall part of it.</p>
               <p>It is true, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>7</label> ſometimes in Scripture, by a Synechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, a part is put for the whole: as the perſons of men
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:112049:91"/>and women, conſiſting of bodies and ſoules, are called ſoules, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.14. and elſewhere: But 1. this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done in deſcriptions or declarations of things: as when the <hi>Holyghoſt</hi> deſcribes the creation of man, expreſſe mention is made, both of the materiall part, the duſt of the earth, and likewiſe of the formall, <hi>Gods breathing in his face the breath of life.</hi> Neither in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is that to be called the deſcription of a thing, which conceales and ſilenceth that which is beſt and the moſt beautifull part of it, and onely mentioneth ſomewhat of inferiour conſideration in it. Secondly, when ſuch a figure is uſed, a part put for the whole, it is ſeldome or never, that the worſer and more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble part is mentioned, but ſtill the formall and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, as bodies are no where put for the perſons of men, but onely Soules: Except (happily) in two caſes: 1. when the whole comes under conſideration and is ſpoken of, by reaſon of the inferiour part, as ſomtimes the body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or fleſh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is put for <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe as man, and for the whole humane nature of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> namely when that which is ſpoken of him, hath its relation to him, in reſpect of his body or fleſh. Or elſe 2. when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the weakneſſe and contemptibleneſſe of the condition of the whole, then (ſomtimes) he calls the whole by the name of that which is the weakeſt part of it, and the ground or cauſe of the vanitie and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the whole. As when it is ſaid, that <hi>All fleſh is graſſe,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>fleſh,</hi> meaning Men, in reſpect of their weake and vaniſhing condition in this world. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which caſes can be pretended in that deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> Thirdly (and laſtly) when this Figure Synechdoche is uſed in any of theſe or the like caſes, a part being put for the whole, it is when things are plaine and evident, ſo that by the part which is named and expreſſed, that may readily be underſtood
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:112049:92"/>which is implyed, as eaſie to be made out, either by other places of Scripture, or by common ſence, as in the inſtances given. <hi>All fleſh is graſſe:</hi> by <hi>fleſh</hi> here, no man can underſtand any thing elſe, but men cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fleſh. So <hi>Acts</hi> 7. where <hi>Iacob</hi> is ſaid to come down into <hi>Egypt</hi> with threeſcore and fifteen ſoules: no man can think that theſe ſoules came with him without their bodies. But now it is farre otherwiſe in this deſcription of <hi>iuſtification</hi> commended unto us by <hi>Paul.</hi> That by forgiveneſſe of ſins, ſhould be meant, both forgiveneſſe of a mans own ſins, and <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe,</hi> if it ſhould be true, yet is it no wayes neceſſary: neither is it any waies apparent, that theſe are parts of the ſame whole, of one and the ſame <hi>iuſtification:</hi> neither is there any thing expreſly delivered in any part of the Scripture to eſtabliſh it. Therfore it is no wayes probable (even in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that when <hi>Paul</hi> placeth a mans <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> before <hi>God</hi> in the forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes, that he ſhould doe it by the figure Synecdoche, onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning one part, and implying another.</p>
               <p>Againe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>8</label> 2. if forgiveneſſe of ſins be but a part, and the worſer halfe of our <hi>iuſtification,</hi> then when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are iuſtified by his blood</hi> (as <hi>Rom</hi> 5.9.) the interpretation muſt be: we are juſtified by halfe through his blood, but the better of our <hi>iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> muſt come another way. For by his <hi>blood</hi> or <hi>death,</hi> we cannot have his active <hi>righteouſneſſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to us.

                  </gap> the forgiveneſſe of a mans ſins, will not amount to a <hi>iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> without the <hi>imputation</hi> of a legall <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse</hi> joyned with it, we muſt give a checke to <hi>Pauls</hi> pen, as the High Prieſts did unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> Joh. 16.21. <hi>Write not, the King of the Iewes:</hi> but that he ſaid, <hi>I am
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:112049:92"/>the King of the Jewes:</hi> So muſt we ſay unto <hi>Paul,</hi> doe not write, that <hi>the guift is of many offences unto Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:</hi> but, <hi>the guift is of many offences, and of many acts of righteouſneſse too imputed, to Iuſtification.

               <p>Thirdly, that forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is a mans entire and compleat <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> and that there is no ſuch further piece or part of it, as is pretended concerning the imputation of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſse,</hi> will appeare from hence, becauſe that end, for which this imputed <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is thus brought into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of <hi>iuſtification, viz.</hi> to be the right or title of the <hi>iuſtified</hi> to their heavenly inheritance, is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſupplyed by the wiſdome and counſell of <hi>God,</hi> and that in a way more Euangelicall, and of more ſweetneſſe and deerneſſe to the children of <hi>God, viz.</hi> by the grace of <hi>adoption,</hi> or Son-ſhip (as we ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew (<hi>God</hi> willing) in the reaſon following.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:112049:93"/>which ſhines forth gloriouſly in the face thereof. I would have every thing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, and every thing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, and every thing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered to be diſtinguiſhed, not only in themſelves, but alſo in their proper and immediate effects, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively ariſeing and flowing from them ſeverally. A pluralitie of cauſes may meet together in one and the ſame effect, and yet the diverſitie and difference of their ſeverall operations and influences contributing towards the raiſeing and produceing of ſuch an effect, may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed and apprehended. The goodneſſe of the ſoyle, the labour of the Oxe, the Plough, the ſeed that is ſowne; the Husbandmans paines in ploughing, in ſowing, his skill in both; the raine given from heaven to water that which is ſowne: all theſe and ſuch like, meet together in one joynt and common effect at the time of Harveſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Husbandmans benefit or increaſe. Yet is there ſcarce any man ſo much a ſtranger to the method and principles of Husbandry, but can aſſigne to every one of theſe cauſes, their proper and ſpeciall effect, though all meeting together in that great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon effect we ſpeake of: the ſoyle is for one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Oxe for another, the Plough for a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So is it true, that all that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, and all that he did, and all that he ſuffered, meet together in that great and common effect, the <hi>ſalvation of them that beleeve:</hi> yea, many of them meet by the way, in the <hi>juſtification</hi> of ſuch, before they come to their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end: yet to juſtifie the wonderfull and deep wiſdome of <hi>God,</hi> as we ought to doe, in bringing about this great work of the ſalvation of the world, we muſt enquire after and find out peculiar and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct reaſons and ends, for all that variety of things which is to be found in or about <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as why he ſhould be <hi>God,</hi> and why he ſhould be Man, what both
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:112049:94"/>the one and the other of theſe peculiarly contributes towards the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of men, why he ſhould be born, why born of a Virgin, why he ſhould grow up and live till he came to the perfect ſtature and age of a man, why he ſhould be <hi>circumciſed,</hi> why <hi>fullfill</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> why preach the <hi>Goſpell</hi> before his <hi>death,</hi> why at laſt he ſhould ſuffer <hi>death;</hi> why <hi>die</hi> upon the Croſſe; why hee ſhould be <hi>buried;</hi> why hee ſhould <hi>riſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many more particulars of like nature that might be mentioned: all which have their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and peculiar working towards the great worke of <hi>ſalvation</hi> (as in a benigne conſtellation every Staire gives out his peculiar influence by himſelfe.) As all Rivers fall into the Sea and meet there in one, though the courſe of their waters lie from all parts under Heaven, from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, from North and South: So whatever <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, and whatever he did, ſpake, and ſuffered, though they are things much differing in themſelves, and in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and proper effects, yet they all meet and center in that common and glorious effect, the <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that beleeve.</hi> And for men not to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe in due manner, aſwell in their effects and purpoſes, as in their natures, is not only to confound themſelves, but (which is worſe) to confound that moſt exquiſite and admirably-beautifull frame of the Goſpell, and (as it were) of a defenced City, to make a ruinous heap. From the guilt of which confuſion-making in the Goſpell, how unpoſſible it is fairely to acquit ſuch an <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> as hitherto we have oppoſed, will further appeare in the reaſons enſuing.</p>

                  </gap>) <hi>to be made [or to become] the Sonnes of God.</hi> Doubtleſſe this grace, or prerogative of <hi>Adoption</hi> and <hi>Sonne-ſhip,</hi> is not given unto men by <hi>God</hi> in vaine, not for the ſweet ſound only that the letter or name of <hi>Adoption</hi> makes in the cares: it hath relation to ſome further matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſequence depending thereon. It is given as an immediate capacitie, or qualification to thoſe that <hi>beleeve,</hi> to make them capable of their everlaſting inheritance: their <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> is the proper and next ground of that inveſtiture unto them. The Scriptures are in nothing more expreſſe then this. <hi>If we be Children, then alſo heires, even heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 8.17. So againe: <hi>Wherefore thou art no more a Servant but a Son &amp; if a Son, then an heire of God through Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 4, 7. As if he ſhould ſay, we are therefore made Sonnes, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted to be Sonnes, that ſo by right of this Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we might be heires of <hi>God,</hi> and by the right of this Heyr-ſhip come to inherit that immortall, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed inheritance, which fadeth not away, with <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelfe. The reaſon or ſtrength of that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or conſequence, <hi>If Sonnes then Heires,</hi> ſeems to ſtand in this: becauſe though amongſt men all that are Sons, are not Heires, if we ſpeake of Sonnes by nature, but only he that is the firſt borne: yet Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by Adoption (I conceive) hath alwaies reſpect to an inheritance, a man never adopteth a child, but with an intent or purpoſe to make him his heire. So that though in the caſe of Son-ſhip by nature, it will not follow, <hi>If Sons then heires,</hi> yet in the caſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, it will. And this (we know) is the caſe and condition of <hi>Beleevers:</hi> they are Sons of <hi>God,</hi> not by nature, but by Adoption. Vnleſſe (perhaps) we will rather conceive the reaſon of the inference to lye in this: that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argueth and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:112049:96"/>upon the ſuppoſition of this truth, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, or that inheritance which <hi>God</hi> hath provided for his Saints, is of another nature, and hath a preheminence and perfection above any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritance, as in a thouſand other reſpects, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this, that it may be injoyed, poſſeſſed and inherited by all the Children of <hi>God,</hi> though in number never ſo many, upon ſuch terms, that every one may enjoy, and poſſeſſe the whole, and no mans portion or poſſeſſion here ſuffers any loſſe or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution at all, though all his Brethren enjoy the ſame Portion and poſſeſſion with him.

But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans enjoyment and poſſeſſion hereof is as full and entire to him, as if the Sun ſhined to him alone, and there were no other to divide the comfort with him. Doubtleſſe if this propertie were to be found in any mans Earthly eſtate or inheritance, that it would goe as far, and hold out as good meaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many, as among few, or as given but to one: though a man had never ſo many Children, yet this conſequence would hold good, <hi>if Sons, then heires,</hi> he would beſtow his whole eſtate aſwell upon his laſt-borne, as his firſt. But becauſe there is a defect or imperfection this way in earthly inheritances, therefore it followes not with men, <hi>if Sonnes then heires:</hi> but with <hi>God</hi> it doth, becauſe ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:112049:96"/>hath no place, in his heavenly inheritance. But howſoever, whether the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the Apoſtles infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in theſe places, reſts either in this, or in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſideration, or in any other: evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it is that the grace or guift of Adoption is given by <hi>God</hi> unto <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers</hi> for an Euangelicall capacitie, right, or title to the Kingdome of Heaven. And therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever opinion or notion riſeth up, to magnifie it ſelfe againſt it, by diſſolving and fruſtrateing the uſe, end, and intention of it, is certainly Anti-euangellicall, and not to be received, though an Angell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhould bring it. This for the major Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſyllogiſme, rather by way of explication, then confirmation: for being rightly underſtood, it cannot lightly be denied.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption followeth: <hi>But ſuch an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteouſneſse of Chriſt as is contended for,</hi>

                  <hi>diſſolves the end, and uſe of Adoption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is evident from the expreſſe declaration or interpretation which themſelves make of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, who are the abettors and maintainers of it. For wherefore is this imputation of <hi>Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſse</hi> introduced into the buſineſſe of <hi>Iuſtification?</hi> The introducers generally make but one mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and ſay, that the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be imputed unto us, that ſo we may have a right and title to life, or to Heaven, according to the tenor of the Covenant: <hi>Hoc fac, et vive:</hi> do this and live. For by remiſſion of ſinnes (ſay they, and truely) a man is only delivered from death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, due unto ſinne: but there accrues or growes no right or title to the Kingdome of Heaven from remiſſion of ſinnes unto any man. And ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:112049:97"/>nothing elſe within reach in or about a <hi>beleever,</hi> meet or fit to make a plea or title of there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they have compelled the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to take this honour and office upon it, in a way of <hi>imputation.</hi> Neither indeed is it eaſy to conjecture or conceive, what other ſervice this <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> imputed ſhould doe in <hi>juſtification,</hi> or for what other end or purpoſe it ſhould be introduced upon ſuch termes, and in ſuch a way, then to qualifie men with a capacity for Heaven.

               <p>If it be heere objected and ſaid, that both may ſtand together, imputation of a perfect <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Adoption</hi> both: why may they not together make a twofold coard, a ſtronger and more effectuall title, then either alone?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere, No: they will not twiſt, or winde or worke together: not ſo much becauſe of the diverſitie and contrariety of their natures, as the clay and yron would not worke and mix together in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image (though this might be a ſufficient conſideration, I conceive, to build a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive anſwere upon, Legalls and Euangellicalls will not joyne or combine to make a title to Heaven)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:112049:97"/>but chiefly becauſe either of them, aſwell the one as the other, is a compleate and intire title within it ſelfe.

                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21 and upon occaſion of the paſſage, to reaſon the point a little further. <hi>I do not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) abrogate the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:112049:98"/>grace of God: for if righteouſneſſe be by the Law, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt hath died in vaine:</hi> A man with his firſt thoughts, may thinke the inference ſomewhat ſtrange, and that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be too weake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in his premiſes, to be ſo ſore and ſtrong in his Concluſion. For thus a man might counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argue with him. How doth it neceſſarily follow, that if <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> or <hi>juſtification</hi> were by the <hi>Law,</hi> that <hi>Chriſts</hi> death muſt preſently be in vaine? What if there were more meanes of <hi>juſtification,</hi> then one, more doers open into life, then one, one by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> another by the <hi>Law?</hi> were there any harme in this? it may be ſome would enter in at one dore, and ſome at another, as we doe into our Churches: and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be in vaine. But to this I anſwere, true, if it were with <hi>God</hi> and his counſailes and waies, as it is with men, ſuch a concluſion would follow ſuch premiſes but weakly and faintly: but it being with <hi>God</hi> and in his waies as it is, it followes roundly, and faulters not at all. It is with the poore and weake creature called man, in compariſon of the Great and Glorious <hi>God</hi> in this point, as it is with many poore people in the Citie, that live upon the labour of their hands, and work to great ſhops, and rich Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, in reſpect of their great Maſters, to whom they work. It is a common complaint, that they worke for little, and are content to do it, fearing leaſt otherwiſe they might ſtarve: they do much work for a little profit: but their rich Maſters will gaine to ſome purpoſe, or elſe they will not, or care not to trade. So in the caſe we now ſpeake of, men being a feeble and impotent generation, and not able to doe, what, and as they would, count it their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to do the beſt they may: and therefore are content (many times) to raiſe great ſummes of meanes for bringing of ſmaller things to paſſe, it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:112049:98"/>may be in a double or triple proportion above the level of their ends, becauſe they are ſtill jealous and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full about the ſucceſſe of the meanes they uſe: there are many diſticulties and miſcariages incident to the manageing of their deſignes which they cannot foreſee, and therefore when their ends are matters of any great moment and conſequence, or much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, they heape on meanes upon meanes, and are ſcarce ever ſecure, or thinke they have done enough. Neither is it any diſparagement unto them in the world amongſt men like themſelves, though halfe of their meanes be loſt in the iſſue, or be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and redundant becauſe men uſe to beare one with another in ſuch caſes, it being one mans caſe aſwell as anothers from time to time. Yea the Scripture it ſelfe ſeemes to encourage men in the uſe of varietie of meanes, in regard of the uncertainty of the ſucceſle. <hi>In the merning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand: for thou knoweſt not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall proſper, either this or that. Eccleſiaſt.</hi> 11.6. Suppoſe a ſingle dore through Gods Providence might be enough and enough to keepe off the thiefe from the rich mans baggs, yet he makes a double dore, and dore upon dore for that purpoſe: in this caſe it is no pregnant conſequence to reaſon thus: if the ſingle dore were ſufficient to ſecure the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from thiefes, the double dore, and all the reſt of the dores were in vaine. Becauſe though there be no uſe of theſe in keeping out the thiefe (who perhaps never thought of making any attempt upon the treaſure) yet are they of uſe to qualifie the feares of the rich owner, and to make him poſſeſſe his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in more peace. But now with <hi>God,</hi> we know it is otherwiſe: he never raiſeth double meanes for the ſame end, but alwaits makes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as was faid) one meanes for one end: both becauſe hee
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:112049:99"/>knowes, how to attaine his end as infalliably by ſingle meanes as by double: and beſides, becauſe he will have none of his meanes or ordinances laughed to ſcorne, or diſparaged in the leaſt meaſure, or to be deſpiſed or neglected by men. He will not have any two ordinances of his of the ſame occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he will have no contention or emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene them. Conſider that paſſage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21 <hi>Is the Law then againſt the promiſes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul?) God forbid.</hi> No: but how doth he prove it is not? By this argument, becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> cannot give life. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>had there been a Law, that could have given life, righteouſneſſe ſhould have been by the Law:</hi> cleerely implying, that if the <hi>Law</hi> could have given life, which is the proper office and calling (as it were) of the promiſe to doe, then indeed it had bin againſt it, and an enemy to it, and would have taken it's worke (which is it's glorie) out of it's hand. But now ſince it ſerves quite for another purpoſe, the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Promiſe</hi> agree well enough together, and doe not enter-meddle one with anothers worke. So you ſee the ground and bottome of the Apoſtles reaſoning in the forenamed place: <hi>Jf righteouſneſſe be by the Law, then Chriſt hath died in vaine.</hi> He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, and calls that an abrogateing and makeing voyd any the counſailes or ordinances of <hi>God,</hi> when another thing is ſet up with them, to bring the ſame end to paſſe, or to ſerve in the ſame place and office, whereunto they are appointed. And doubtleſſe by authority and warrant of the ſame ground, we may ſet this paralell propoſition at the right hand of that of <hi>Paul: If our right and title to Heaven be by imputati on of Chriſt's righteouſnes, then doth God give the grace of</hi> ADOPTION <hi>in vaine.</hi> And this for our fourth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt that Imputation.</p>

               <p>To this I anſwere, by denying the conſequence of that which is brought to <hi>juſtify</hi> the Exception. When the Scriptures ſay that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>imputed,</hi> for, or inſtead of the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> the intent and meaning is not, as if <hi>God</hi> either <hi>imputed,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

He that fulfilleth the <hi>Law,</hi> and thereby is <hi>juſtifyed,</hi> is <hi>juſtified</hi> out of the inherent &amp; internall dignity of that which <hi>juſtifyeth</hi> him: but he that is <hi>juſtified</hi> by Faith, is not juſtifyed by the inherent dignity, or merit of that which <hi>juſtifyeth</hi> him, but by the free and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acceptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>A Sixt ground againſt the ſame <hi>imputation</hi> of the <hi>active obedience of Chriſt,</hi> is: it takes away the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his <hi>death.</hi> If men be as <hi>righteous</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe was in his <hi>life,</hi> there were no more neceſſity of his <hi>death</hi> for them, then ther was either of his own <hi>death,</hi> or of the <hi>death</hi> of any other, for himſelfe. If we were perfectly <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>righteous</hi> in him, or with him, in his <hi>life,</hi> then the <hi>juſt</hi> ſhould not have died for the unjuſt (as the Scriptures ſpeak) for whoſe ſalvation there was a neceſſitie he ſhould <hi>die:</hi> but he ſhould have died for the <hi>juſt,</hi> for whom there was no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie why he ſhould die. This Reaſon the Apoſtle expreſly delivers. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If righteouſneſſe be by the Law, then Chriſt died in vaine.</hi> I deſire the unpartiall Reader to obſerve narrowly the force of this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt: If righteouſneſſe</hi> (or, <hi>juſtification) be by the Law, then Chriſt died in vaine.</hi> Men cannot here betake themſelves to their wonted Sanctuary and Refuge, to ſay that by the <hi>Law,</hi> is to be underſtood the works of the <hi>Law,</hi> as performed by a mans ſelfe in perſon: Nay their own interpretation here will betray their opinion into the hand of this Reaſon, that fights againſt it. For by the word <hi>Law,</hi> in this place, underſtand the works of the <hi>Law,</hi> as performed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the conſequence will riſe up rather with the greater ſtrength and power againſt them. <hi>If righteouſneſſe were by the works of the Law,</hi> as performed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, if the <hi>imputation</hi> of them were our compleat &amp; abſolute <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for us had bin apparently in vaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>righteouſnes</hi> of his <hi>life imputed,</hi> had bina ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, &amp; every waies a compleat <hi>righteouſnes</hi> for us.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be here ſaid, <label type="milestone">

For certainly this <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of his <hi>life</hi> was as capable of ſuch an <hi>imputation,</hi> before and with out his <hi>death,</hi> as after, or with it.

               <p>Not to repeat what was ſo lately delivered in full for ſatisfaction and Anſwere to this Objection: I yet further adde <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> that when <hi>Faith</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> in <hi>juſtification,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> it is evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that it is not the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of the Law it ſelfe that is <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> but another thing, <hi>Faith</hi> by name, inſtead of it.

For the conditions or terms of agreement in a Covenant, are as formall and eſſentiall a part of a Covenant, as any other thing belonging to it. Though there be the ſame parties Covenanting, and the ſame things Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted for or about: yet if there be new articles of agreement, it is really a new bargaine and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant.

               <p>But it may be there are ſome, that are more ſhie of this conſequence: that ſtick not to hold the <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> (in the ſenſe oppoſed) and yet demuire upon an identitie of the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: they doe not conceive this to be the fruite of that wombe. Wherefore to prove, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath no wrong at all, in having this dead child layed by her ſide, for her owne, I thus reaſon. Where the parties covenanting are the ſame, and the things covenanted for, the ſame, and the conditions or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement the ſame, there the Covenants are every waies the ſame. But if the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of the <hi>Law imputed</hi> to us, be the agreement or condition of the Now Covenant, all the three, perſons, things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, are the ſame. Therefore the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, firſt, and ſecond, the old and the new, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very waies the ſame: becauſe as concerning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, the parties Covenanting, and the things covenanted for, it is agreed on both ſides, that they are the ſame.</p>
               <p>If it be Objected and ſaid: <hi>That the righteouſneſſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:112049:106"/>of the Law imputed from another, and perſonally wrought by a mans ſelſe, are two deffering conditions: therfore it doth not follow, that the Covenants ſhould be the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Anſwere, that the ſubſtance of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will ſtill be found the ſame notwithſtanding: the works, or <hi>righteouſneſse of the Law</hi> are the ſame, by whomſoever wrought: If <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>fulfilled</hi> the Law, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, he had bin <hi>juſtified</hi> by the ſame <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> wherewith Chriſt himſelfe was <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be yet ſaid: that <hi>Imputation in the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was not in the firſt, makes a reall difference in the condition.</hi> To this I anſwere two things in two words: 1. <hi>Imputation</hi> of <hi>works</hi> or of <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> is not the condition of the new Covenant, but <hi>beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> If <hi>imputation</hi> were the condition, then the whole Covenant ſhould lye upon <hi>God,</hi> and nothing ſhould be required on the creatures part: for <hi>imputation</hi> is an act of <hi>God,</hi> not of men. 2. I anſwere, that if it were granted, that <hi>the righteouſneſse or the works of the Law imputed from</hi> Chriſt, <hi>were that whereby we are iuſtified,</hi> yet they muſt <hi>iuſtifie,</hi> not as <hi>imputed,</hi> but as <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> or works of the Law. Therfore <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> makes no difference in this reſpect. <hi>Imputation</hi> can be no part of that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> by which we are <hi>iuſtified,</hi> becauſe it is no conformity with any Law, nor with any part or branch of any Law (eſpecially of any Law that Man was ever bound to keep.) Therfore it can be no part of that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> by which he is to be <hi>iuſtified.</hi> So that the condition of both Covenants will be found every waies the ſame, (and conſequently both Covenants every wayes the ſame) if <hi>iuſtification</hi> be maintained by the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of Chriſt imputed.</hi>

               <p>For the conſequence in the Major Propoſition, it is ſo evident in common apprehenſion, that to labour any further illuſtration of it, were but to light up a Candle to the Sun.

The reaſon of the Minor, is this: becauſe the meritorious cauſe being a kind of efficient (as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed on all hands) cannot be either the matter or the forme of that, whereof it is efficient. Wherfore if the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt be the meritorious-effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of our <hi>iuſtification,</hi> unpoſſible it is, that by any contriving or caſting, or bringing about either by <hi>imputation</hi> or otherwiſe, it ſhould ever be found or made either the matter or the forme of this <hi>iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For this is famouſly known to be an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviolable Law amongſt the foure kinds of cauſes, materiall, formall, finall and efficient: that the two former only doe <hi>ingredi compoſitum</hi> or <hi>effectum,</hi> and are <hi>partes reiconſtitutae,</hi> i. are intrinſecall and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall parts of the effect, or thing produced: and that the two latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the finall and efficient, are all waies extrinſecall, and ſtand without. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:112049:108"/>when a Plaiſterer or Painter whites a wall, the effect of his worke is the whiteneſſe of the wall, or the wall as made white. Now into this effect, this whiteneſſe of the wall, there is none of the efficient cauſes producing lt, either any part of it, or any ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient into it; neither the plaiſterer himſelfe, who is the principall efficient cauſe of it, nor his bruſh or penſill, which is the inſtrumentall efficient cauſe, nor the money or wages he receives for the doing it, which is as the meritorious efficient cauſe of it. None of all theſe, is any intrinſecall or conſtituting part of the effect, neither as the matter, nor as the forme thereof.

               <p>Secondly, if that part only of the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which ſtood in his obedience to the Morall Law, be <hi>imputed</hi> unto us for <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> in our <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> then will there not be found the ſame way or meanes of <hi>juſtification</hi> for the whole body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but the beleeving Jewes before <hi>Chriſts</hi> death, muſt be made <hi>righteous</hi> or juſtified with one
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:112049:110"/>kind of <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> and the Gentiles with another. For the Jewes before the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of both parts of this <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> to be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> to them in their <hi>juſtification</hi> (ſuppoſing their <hi>juſtification</hi> had ſtood in ſuch an <hi>imputation,</hi> as ſome ſtand up to maintaine) aſwell ceremoniall as morall.

               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of Chriſt, which is called Morall, if ſeparated and divided from the other part which is Ceremoniall, was not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> in him: becauſe it <hi>became him to fulfill all righteouſneſse</hi>) aſwell cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall as Morall) <hi>Mat</hi> 3.15.

This conſequence is blameleſſe: becauſe there is the ſame reaſon of the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt, that is of the imputation of his righteouſneſſe to us: at leaſt, ſuch is the confeſſion generall of thoſe that are pleaſed with oppoſite thoughts in this queſtion, (as was formerly ſignified.)</q>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:112049:112"/>
               <p>But that our ſinnes are not <hi>imputed</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in any ſuch manner, <hi>viz.</hi> in the letter and formality of them, I thus demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>If the ſins of men be <hi>imputed</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the letter and formality of them, then <hi>God</hi> looks upon him and reputes him in his ſufferings as one that truly and really had provoked him and ſin'd againſt him.

               <q>But God doth not looke upon Chriſt in his ſufferings or reput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him as one that had truly and really ſinned againſt him. Therefore our ſins are not imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him after any ſuch manner in his ſufferings.</q>
               <p>The truth of the Aſſumption I thus make manifeſt:
<q>If God looks upon Chriſt in his death, as one that had truly ſin'd againſt him, then he looks upon him as one having deſerved the death he ſuffers. <hi>The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſequence is apparent:</hi> becauſe as to ſin, and to deſerve death, are <hi>termini converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> expreſſions of the ſame importance: ſo to look upon a man as a ſinner, and as one that hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death, are but the ſame looke.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But that <hi>God</hi> doth not looke upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his ſufferings, as one that had deſerved that things he ſuffers, is evident:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe as <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered himſelfe without ſpot unto <hi>God,</hi> ſo <hi>God</hi> looked upon him in that his offering. Otherwiſe, if he had overlooked that ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe of his, and imputed ſin unto him in ſtead thereof. What had this bin, but to have put dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for light, and call good, evill? which to affirme,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:112049:113"/>or once to conceive of <hi>God,</hi> may be called the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orne of a blaſpemous ignorance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if <hi>God</hi> looked upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as haveing deſerved death, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>2</label> his death could not have bin accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſatisfactory for others. For as he that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved death, cannot by his death deſerve the ſparing of others from death, who have deſerved it, aſwell as he, becauſe ſuch a mans death only anſwers his own perſonall demerit or ſin, as he that oweth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſumme of money, cannot by the payment therof diſcharge any mans debt, but his own: So neither can the reputing of any man to have deſerved death, be made conſiſtent with a reputeing of ſuch a mans death, to be expiatorie, or ſatisfactory for the taking of the guilt of death from others, except we ſuppoſe him that reputeth in this caſe, to be, either unable to diſcerne or apprehend, or elſe fully able to reconcile and compoſe the broadeſt contradictions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) if <hi>God</hi> look'd upon him in his death, as deſerving to die, then did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer death, not for our ſins, as they are ours, but as they were his (by <hi>imputation.</hi>) Whereas the Scriptures every where teſtifie of his ſuffering death for our ſins, but never for any ſinne of his own, no more by <hi>imputation</hi> then by inheſion. And the truth is, looke in what ſence our ſins may be ſaid to have bin <hi>imputed</hi> to him in the ſame ſence they may be ſaid to have bin inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in him: yea the inherencie of them in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon him (wherein they ſtuck cloſe to him indeed) is all the imputation the Scriptures know, or ſpeake of. <hi>He laide upon him the iniquity of us all</hi> Eſa. 53.6, <hi>viz.</hi> in the puniſhment due to it and deſerved by it. So againe: <hi>Who himſelfe bare our ſins in his own body, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. that is, the puniſhment of our ſins (as we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew further, <hi>God</hi> willing in the ſecond part of this diſcourſe.)</p>

                  <p>If the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, be, in the letter and formality of it imputed unto us in our juſtification, then doth God looke upon us as worthy of that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which we receive from him.</p>
                  <p>But this is an uncleane ſaying: therfore the former, out of which it is brought, is uncleane alſo.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The conſequence in the major Propoſition, is like Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and cannot be moved. For if <hi>God</hi> reputes me to have kept the Law, as perfectly as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, he muſt conceive of me, as worthy of my <hi>juſtification.</hi> For as the fulfilling of the Law, and deſerving <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> are but the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. So the reputeing of a man to have done the one, is the reputeing of him to have deſerved the other.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the minor Propoſition (if it be not reaſon enough it ſelfe) <hi>viz. that God doth not looke upon us as worthy that Iuſtification which we receive,</hi> is this: becauſe then <hi>God</hi> ſhould ſhew us no grace or favour at all in our <hi>Juſtification</hi> (Rom 4.4. with Rom. 11.6.) but if any favour be ſhewed, it is only in this, that he reputeth us worthy to be <hi>Iuſtified,</hi> or puts a worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon us for <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> Whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſly affirmeth, that <hi>God</hi> juſtifieth, not the worthy, but the ungodly, that is, the unworthy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.</p>

                  <p>But men are not made formally ſinfull by Gods act of imputeing Adams ſinne unto them (becauſe then an act of God ſhould be, as it were the life and ſoule of that ſin, which is in men) Therfore men are not made formally juſt or righteous by any act of God imputeing righteouſneſſe unto them.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Argument (I conceive) is of no eaſie ſolution to thoſe who maintain the <hi>imputation</hi> it ſelfe of this <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and not the <hi>righteouſneſſe imputed,</hi> to be the form of <hi>juſtification.</hi> Which yet I conceive to be an apprehenſion every whit as rationall, as that which on the other hand, maintaineth the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse</hi> it ſelfe of <hi>Chriſt imputed,</hi> to be this forme.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:112049:117"/>of men in themſelves, and conſequently the errors oppoſite to them, have a more pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencie with reaſon: and for the diſcoverie of ſuch, both errors and truths, a weaker and fainter light of argumentation, is (for the moſt part) ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: but againe there are other truths, whoſe ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation lyeth at a greater diſtance from thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore let us yet contend with ſome further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, to bring the concluſion laboured for, into a cleere and perfect light, that it may be no charge or trouble at all, to the minds and thoughts of men to receive it.</p>

                  <p>But the righteouſneſse of the Law, pretended to be imputed from Chriſt, in juſtification, had it been wrought by our ſelves, in our owne perſons, could not have been our iuſtification, nor any part of that righteouſneſse by which we were to be juſtified.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this righteouſneſse of Chriſt cannot be made our juſtification, nor any part of it, by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The major (I conceive) hath more reaſon in it, then to be denyed. If a perſonall fulfilling of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:112049:118"/>Law, could have bin no <hi>juſtification</hi> nor part of <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> to us, certainly an imputative fulfilling of it could not have bin either. The imputation of a thing from another cannot adde any ſtrength or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to it, above a perſonall acting or working, yea the nature and intent of imputation (in the ſenſe we now ſpeake of it) is only to ſupplie the defect of perſonall performance, therefore it cannot exceed it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>minor;</hi> that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> which was performed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> could not have bin our <hi>juſtification</hi> either in whole, or in part, in caſe it had bin performed by our ſelves, is evident from hence: becauſe man being once fallen by ſinning againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> and made obnoxious to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can never be raiſed or recovered againe by ten thouſand obſervations of this <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> was able to have given life, had it alwaies bin fulfilled, and never broken: but unto him that had once fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the obſervation of it, though he had bin made able to have kept it ten times afterward, it had no power at all to give either life or <hi>juſtification.</hi> The guilt of that ſinne wherin he had once ſinned, could never have bin purged by any Law-righteouſneſſe: noactive obedience whatſoever, would ever have bin an attonement for him. <hi>Without ſhedding of blood, there is no remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> Heb. 9.22.</p>
               <p>Let me joyne another argument of the ſame line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and ſtock with the former.</p>

                  <p>But men are not bound by any Law or command from God to obſerve the Moral Law for their juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore the obſervation of it cannot be imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:112049:118"/>them from any other, for any ſuch end.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The reaſon of the <hi>major</hi> propoſition (if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſticks there) is: becauſe imputation, in the ſenſe it is ſtill taken by our adverſaries in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, muſt be found out and ordained by <hi>God</hi> to ſupplie perſonall defects and inabilities. But where there is no <hi>Law</hi> or command given unto men to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, there can be no perſonall defect: It is no ſinne or defect in any man, not to obey, where he hath no command: and conſequently there is no place, nor occaſion for any imputation to ſupplie it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>minor,</hi> there is both ſubſtance and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance enough of truth in it, to privilege it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a propoſition of any further contention or ſtrife.

               <p>If it be here replyed and ſaid: that though <hi>God</hi> requires onely <hi>faith</hi> of men to their <hi>juſtification,</hi> yet he requires ſomwhat more and beſides, at the hand of another thereunto: therfore that which he <hi>imputes</hi> unto men for their <hi>juſtification,</hi> is not neceſſarily that which he requires of themſelves, but rather that which he requires of another for them.</p>

               <p>Give me leave to deliver my laſt Argument, out of the hand of this Objection: and ſo we ſhall draw towards a Concluſion of this firſt part. In my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I ſhall addreſſe my ſelfe to both the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but chiefly inſiſt upon the inſtance that is brought to prove the Minor, to demonſtrate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie and impertinencie of that for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>For the former Propoſition (not to let paſſe <hi>incerta procert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> that which is weake, with the credit and reputation of ſtrength) I anſwere therfore to it, that the conſequence in it is not ſo tight and pregnant, (as happily is conceived) or as the confidence of the demand annexed by way of confirmation, ſeems to import. The imputableneſſe of the tranſgreſſion of the Law, were it granted, is no concluding demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the like imputableneſſe of the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse,</hi> or obedience performed unto it: and then this Propoſition will not be found any ſuch Oracle of truth.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:112049:122"/>
               <p>Firſt, in the tenour of the Law, there is no ſuch emphaticall reſtraint of the guilt or puniſhment due unto the tranſgreſſion of it, to the perſon of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, as ther is of the reward promiſed to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, to the perſon of the obſerver; as we heard in the clauſe cited from Gal. 3.12. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. i.</hi> the very man that hath done them, ſhall live by them: It is no where found on the other hand: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the very man that tranſgreſſeth them, ſhall die for his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As if God in giving the Law, had left unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a libertie and ſcope to derive and carry the guilt and puniſhment due to the tranſgreſſion of the Law, as far as he pleaſed: but had no intent to extend the reward promiſed to the fulfilling of it, beyond the perſon of the fulfiller. Some indeed conceive, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſtanding in obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> had bin the ſtanding and perpetuall confirmation in <hi>grace,</hi> of all his poſterity. If this opinion could be made to appeare any thing more then conjecturall Divinitie, I grant that then, in reſpect of the intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> had been as <hi>imputable,</hi> as the tranſgreſſion of it, but this will not prove it ſuch in the nature of it, but only by way of Covenant: and ſo the conſequence in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition will ſtill languiſh and be infirme. But though I can be confident with <hi>Paul,</hi> to call <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the laſt <hi>Adam.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. Yet I am ſomwhat tender to call <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi> To ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> by his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſhould have merited the <hi>juſtification</hi> of himſelfe and all his poſterity, is (I take it) to make him ſomwhat more then a figure of him that was to come. But to ſay, that by his tranſgreſſion, he merited the condemnation both of himſelfe and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, is no ſuch hard ſaying (I conceive) in the cares of any man. Therefore however, the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:112049:122"/>of the <hi>Law</hi> is not as <hi>imputable,</hi> as the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas demand was made, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>3</label> by way of abſolute confirmation of that former propoſition, what ſhould make any ſuch difference, betweene the obedience of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the tranſgreſſion of the <hi>Law,</hi> that the former ſhould not be as <hi>imputable</hi> as the latter, the obedience, as the tranſgreſſion? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, there may be this conceived as a ground of difference betweene them, in that reſpect. Sinne or diſobedience to a <hi>Law</hi> is ever greater <hi>in ratione demeriti,</hi> in way of demerit or deſert of puniſhment: then obedience or ſubjection to a <hi>Law,</hi> is <hi>in ratione meriti,</hi> in deſerving a reward. One that takes a purſe, or murders a man by the high way ſide, deſerveth to receive more in puniſhment, then a thouſand deſerve in reward, that ſuffer men to travaile peaceably by them. Though he that diſhoneſtly refuſeth to pay a debt where it is due, may deſervedly be caſt into priſon: yet it doth not follow, that he that keeps touch and payeth at his day, deſerves to be exalted to a Throne. So might <hi>Adam</hi> by his tranſgreſſion of the <hi>Law,</hi> merit death and condemnation to himſelfe and poſterity: and yet not have merited life and ſalvation to both, by his obedience. The reaſon of which difference is evident: becauſe if he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and kept the <hi>Law,</hi> he had only done that which was his duty to doe: and this (by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours rule, <hi>Luk</hi> 17.10) <hi>makes but an unprofitable ſervant. i.</hi> (I conceive) is no ground to demand or challenge any great matters at his maſters hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be by Covenant or promiſe from him. <hi>Adams</hi> obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> was a debt due unto <hi>God</hi> from him, ſeverall waies, and in ſundry reſpects or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. Firſt, <hi>God</hi> was his ſoveraigne Lord, and had abſolut power over him, to command him what
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:112049:123"/>ſervice or obedience he pleaſed. Secondly, he was his maker and Creator, and had given him his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and in this reſpect had full right and title to imploy him as he pleaſed. Thirdly, <hi>God</hi> had bin liberall and exceeding bountifull unto him, many waies: he created him in his owne image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: furniſhed him with principles of <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> made him <hi>Lord</hi> over the works of his hand: placed him in a Paradiſe of all delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In all theſe reſpects, <hi>Adam</hi> was a debtor, yea and more then a debtor unto <hi>God,</hi> of that obedience unto his Law, which he required of him. Now the greater debtor <hi>Adam</hi> was unto <hi>God,</hi> the more and greater bands and ingagements were upon him, to make good that obedience which <hi>God</hi> required of him, to his Law: the leſſe meritorious had this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience bin, in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: and the more demeritorious alſo was his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and diſobedience. Therefore that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in the major propoſition of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the tranſgreſſion of the Law be imputable, then is the obedience imputable alſo,</hi> is ſo farre from being legitimate, and ſolid, that the imputableneſſe of the tranſgreſſion of it, rather overthroweth the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the obedience of it, then any waies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth or eſtabliſheth it. For the more imputable, that is, puniſhable, the tranſgreſſion of it is, the leſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, that is, rewardable, is the obedience of it. So that you ſee, now we have touch'd the hollow of the right thigh of the Objection, how it halts right downe upon it. And you ſee withall, how we might fairely and honeſtly diſcharge our ſelves from having any thing more to doe with the Minor Propoſition, or with the inſtance of the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, which was inſiſted upon for the proofe of it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:112049:123"/>if either Propoſition be diſabled, the glory of the whole Argument is layed in the duſt.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne to his poſteritie (as it is ordinarily phraſed) is conceived to be a maſter veyne in this Controverſie, and is frequently produced to prove the <hi>imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> (by way of analogie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.) I ſhall be willing to lay downe with as much brevitie and plaineneſſe as I can, how, and in what ſenſe onely, either the Scriptures themſelves, or ſound reaſon, will countenance the notion of that <hi>imputation.</hi> The iſſue will be, that neither the one nor the other will be found, either to owne or favour any other <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin to his poſterity, then we have hitherto granted of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> to thoſe that <hi>beleeve:</hi> The <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, i.</hi> is made over or given to thoſe that <hi>beleeve,</hi> not in the letter or formality of it (as hath bin often ſaid) but in bleſſings, priviledges and benefits, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>merit</hi> or <hi>mediation</hi> of it. So the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is <hi>imputed</hi> to his poſterity, not in the letter and formality of it (which is the <hi>imputation</hi> commonly urged) but in the demerit of it, <hi>i.</hi> in the curſe or puniſhment due to it (which is the <hi>imputation</hi> commonly urged) but in the demerit of it, <hi>i.</hi> in the curſe or puniſhment due to it, or deſerved by it. Therfore as concerning this <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, I anſwere.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Scripture no where affirms, either the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to his poſterity, or of the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> to thoſe that beleeve: neither is the phraſe or manner of ſuch ſpeaking, any waies agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Dialect or language of the Holy Ghoſt. For ſtill in the Scriptures, wherſoever the word or term of IMPUTING is uſed, it is only applyed unto, or ſpoken of ſomthing of the ſame perſons, to whom the <hi>imputation</hi> is ſaid to be made, and never (to my remembrance) to, or of any thing of anothers, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:112049:124"/>4.3. <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was</hi> IMPUTED <hi>to him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> i. his own beleeving was <hi>imputed</hi> to him, not another mans. So verſe 5. But <hi>to him that worketh not, but beleeveth, His Faith is</hi> IMPUTED <hi>to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.30, 31. <hi>Phineas ſtood up and executed judgement,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that (viz.</hi> act of his) <hi>was</hi> IMPUTED <hi>to him for righteouſneſſe. i.</hi> received a teſtimony from <hi>God</hi> of being a righteous and holy act. So againe, 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>not</hi> IMPUTING <hi>their trespaſſes (i.</hi> their own treſpaſſes) <hi>unto them.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>5</label> when a thing is ſaid ſimply to be <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> ſinne, folly, and ſo <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> or the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the meaning of the phraſe is not to be taken concerning the bare acts of the things, as if (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) to impute ſin to a man, ſignified this, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the man (to whom ſin is <hi>imputed</hi>) to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a ſinfull act: or, as if to <hi>impute</hi> folly, were ſimply to charge a man to have done fooliſhly: but the phraſe of <hi>imputing,</hi> when it is applyed to things that are evill, and attributed to perſons that have a power of judicature over thoſe, to whom the <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> is made (in which poſture only, to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the word is found in Scripture) ſignifieth, the charging of the guilt or demerit of what is ſaid to be <hi>imputed,</hi> upon the head of the perſon to whom the <hi>imputation</hi> is made, with an intent of inflicting ſome condigne puniſhment upon him. So that to <hi>impute</hi> ſinne (in Scripture phraſe) is to charge the guilt of ſin upon a man with a purpoſe to puniſh him for it. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Sinne is ſaid not to be</hi> IMPUTED, <hi>whileſt there is no Law.</hi> The meaning cannot be, that that act which a man doth, whether there be a Law or no Law, ſhould not be <hi>imputed</hi> to him. The Law doth not make any act to be <hi>imputed,</hi> or aſcribed to a man, which might not aſwell have bin <hi>imputed</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:112049:124"/>it. But the meaning is, that there is no guilt of any act charged by <hi>God</hi> upon men, nor any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted upon men for any thing done by them, but only by vertue of the Law prohibiting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreyning it. In which reſpect the Law is ſaid to be <hi>the ſtrength of ſinne,</hi> viz. becauſe it giveth a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power againſt the doer, to that, which otherwiſe would have had none, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. So againe, <hi>Job</hi> 24.12. when it is ſaid, <hi>that God doth not lay folly to the charge of them (i impute</hi> folly to them) that make the ſoules of the ſlaine to cry out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the meaning is not, that <hi>God</hi> doth not repute them to have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the acts of oppreſſion, murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For ſuppoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they did ſuch things, it is unpoſſible but that <hi>God</hi> ſhould repute them to have done them: but the meaning is, that <hi>God</hi> doth not viſibly charge the guilt of theſe ſins upon them, or inflict puniſhment for them. So 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.19. When <hi>Shimei</hi> prayeth <hi>David</hi> not to IMPUTE wickedneſſe unto him, his meaning is not, to deſire <hi>David</hi> not to think he had done wickedly in rayling upon him (for himſelfe confeſſeth this in the very next words) but that <hi>David</hi> would not inflict that puniſhment upon him, which that wickedneſſe deſerved. This was that <hi>non-imputation</hi> of wickedneſſe which <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> deſired of <hi>David</hi> So when <hi>David</hi> himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the man <hi>bleſſed, to whom the Lord</hi> IMPU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TETH <hi>not ſinne,</hi> his meaning is not, as if there were any man, whom the <hi>Lord</hi> would not repute to have committed thoſe acts of ſin, which indeed they have committed: but that ſuch are bleſſed, upon whom <hi>God</hi> will not charge the demerit of their ſins in the puniſhment due to them. So yet againe (to forbeare further citations in this point) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. when <hi>God</hi> is ſaid, <hi>not to</hi> IMPUTE <hi>their ſinnes unto men,</hi> the meaning is not, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould not repute men to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:112049:125"/>have committed ſuch and ſuch ſins againſt him: but this, that he freely diſcharged them from the puniſhment due unto them By all which teſtimonies and inſtances from the Scriputres, concerning the conſtant and ſolemne uſe and ſignification of the terme <hi>imputing,</hi> or <hi>imputation,</hi> it is evident, that the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, the ſtreightneſſe, or narrowneſſe, or ſcantneſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> perſon: Thirdly (and laſtly) that ſpeciall and neere relation that his poſterity had to his perſon.

               <p>Onely I deſire to mention one thing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>9</label> (which to my beſt remembrance) I have not often met with under obſervation in this kind: though it be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration obvious and neere at hand. The ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> hath this peculiar ſtreyne or burden of ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it, wherein it juſtifieth the ſinne even of the reprobate Angells themſelves, being (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) a ſinne more intolerable then theirs, Theſe wicked Angells were entruſted but with their owne portions, reſpectively, and therefore what they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they ſin'd to themſelves, they ſin'd away &amp; ruin'd only their perſonall eſtates in bleſſedneſſ. But <hi>Adam</hi> had a deerer and deeper ingagement upon him, to keep him upright: he had the eſtates of all his poſterity put into his hand: and knew, that if he ſinned and fell, he ſhould draw thouſands thouſands of ſoules after him into the ſame perdition with him: and thoſe ſuch, the things of whoſe peace, ſafety and welfare, the Law, of nature it ſelfe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to provide for, with more care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then of all other creatures whatſoever, being thoſe that were to be his owne naturall children, <hi>even fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bone:</hi> the ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which relation the Apoſtle averreth (in this
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:112049:127"/>reſpect) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. where he ſaith, <hi>that Children ought not to lay up for the Parents, but Parents for the Children.</hi> If it be eſteemed a ſore brand (as well it may) upon the wickedneſſe of <hi>Ieroboam, that he made Iſrael to ſinne:</hi> and yet this was no other making to ſinne, then what poſſibly might (and ought) to have bin reſiſted and withſtood, by thoſe that were drawne to ſinne by it: then muſt it needs be a far ſoarer charge upon the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> who made not <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely, but the whole world to ſinne: and that in ſuch a way, and by ſuch a making, againſt which there was not the leaſt ſtrength or power in the world to make the leaſt reſiſtance or oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>So then the exceeding ſinfulneſſe or demerit of this ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> being granted, it cannot be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any waies unequall in <hi>God</hi> or repugnant to the rules of juſtice, to inflict an unanſwerable meaſure or weight of puniſhment upon it. Puniſhment is a kind of payment or recompence for an injury or loſſe ſuſteyned. <hi>J paied</hi> (or reſtored) ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 69.4.) <hi>the things that I never tooke. i.</hi> I went under cenſure, and was puniſhed in my good Name and otherwiſe, for offences whereof I was never guilty. The like phraſe of reſtitution by way of puniſhment, you ſhall finde <hi>Iob</hi> 20.18. So that now to require or take in puniſhment, valuably to the loſſe or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a man hath ſuſteyned, hath thus far no appearance of unrighteouſneſſe in it.</p>
               <p>Therefore 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:112049:127"/>this further, that either <hi>God</hi> muſt ſit downe by the loſſe (as we uſe to ſay) and want meanes of coming againe into his owne, or elſe he muſt looke out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Adams</hi> perſon, for more to be joyned in the puniſhment with him, to ſupplie (as it were) that was wanting in him, in that reſpect. In civill and politique States, it is not more uſuall then equall and reaſonable, that when the offence is of a very high nature, as in the caſe of Treaſon and the like <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the puniſhment ſhould not be confin'd to the perſon of the offender (which how great ſoever, is ever leſſe then an offence of that nature) but be further exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, untill the qualitie of the offence be ſomewaies anſwered. Vpon this ground of equitie (I conceive) it was, that <hi>God</hi> would not be ſatiſfied with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall deſtruction (though in a way of extraordinary judgement) of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> their ſin of rebellion againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> riſeing to a greater height then ſo: but involved their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies their wives, their Sons, their little ones, yea their Tents and all their goods, in the puniſhment with them. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.27, 32, 33. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.6.

And if the perſon of the creature offending, be able to pay the whole reckoning and ſumme it ſelfe, the like juſtice ſeemeth to require, that it be not demanded elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, nor any others without their conſent be charged with contributing to it. So that if we ſhall ſuppoſe the perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> to have bin puniſhable according to the height and full extent of his ſin, and yet will ſay, that <hi>God</hi> had power to charge this ſinne upon his poſteritie, this muſt be underſtood of ſuch a power, as indeed <hi>God</hi> hath by way of abſolute pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and ſoveraigntie of dominion over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not of any power he ſtands poſſeſſed of in a way of regular and ordinary juſtice.</p>

               <p>To this I anſwere: Firſt, if this be a truth (as for the preſent I have nothing in a ſtrict way of arguing to oppoſe againſt it directly) that notwithſtanding <hi>God</hi> hath fallen thus heavily upon <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; al his, yet hath not hereby made himſelfe any full ſatisfaction for the offence committed againſt him: this rather tends to eaſe and juſtifie theſe proceedings of <hi>God</hi> in puniſhing aſwell <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie as his perſon, for his offence, that is, for the demerit of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, then any waies infringeth or impleadeth any thing therein. So that we ſhall not need, for the cleering of <hi>Gods juſtice</hi> in troubling all <hi>Adams</hi> poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, to have recourſe to a ſuppoſed <hi>imputation</hi> of the act of this ſinne unto them, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe or demerit of it (which as hath been ſaid, is a thing far differing from, and indeed contra-diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed againſt the act of it) is abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent thereunto.</p>
               <p>Yet ſecondly I anſwere withall: that though the puniſhment of the ſinne poured out upon <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie as well as his perſon, will not hold out full weight and meaſure with the ſinfullneſſe or demerit of it, in which reſpect <hi>God</hi> may ſeeme ſtill to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind hand with the creature, and not to have repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his breach ſufficiently: yet who ſeeth not but that he hath made a far more abundant proviſion for the vindicating of his glorious greatreſſe, by cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this dreadfull tempeſt of his diſpleaſure to raine upon all fleſh, then if <hi>Adams</hi> perſon alone had bin rained upon in this kind, and the expreſſions of his indignation had reached no further. We have a common ſaying: <hi>That where it is not to be had, the King muſt looſe his right.</hi> Certainly if the great and terrible <hi>God</hi> ever payed any ſinne home in wrath
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:112049:129"/>and vengeance, he is not behind hand with this ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>12</label> I anſwere yet once more: that in this reſpect <hi>God</hi> may be ſaid to have made, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelfe full ſatisfaction, in pouring out this fullneſſe of wrath upon <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, not upon his perſon only, but whole poſterity alſo: becauſe he requireth nothing more by way of any further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for that ſinne, but only the abiding or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that wrath and puniſhment which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon it, by <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity. This ſheweth that he is perfectly eaſed of that his great adverſarie. At leaſt wiſe, where he complaineth not, nor maketh any further demand, we cannot ſay that he is unſatisfyed. That ſacrifice which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of his Sonne <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for the taking away or purging the ſinne of the world, was not required by way of addition to that puniſhment, which hee had inflicted upon <hi>Adam</hi> and all his; as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his ſufferings, and men with theirs, ſhould to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make up one and the ſame entire ſatiſfaction unto <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin.

This for anſwer to the objection: and for the ſecond particular; upon which the equity of <hi>Gods</hi> proceedings in involving as-well the whole poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> as his perſon in the puniſhment due to his firſt ſinne, may well be built (as hath bin ſuid) <hi>viz</hi> the narrowneſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> perſon.</p>

His poſteritie was ſo neerely and intirely his, when the ſinne was committed, and the judgment firſt poured out upon it, that they were in his perſon, and as it were a part, or ſomewhat of it. The time was, when all men were but one <hi>Adam:</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it: <hi>Adam erat nos omnes. i.</hi> Adam was us all.
<note place="margin">Auguſtin. <hi>De Peccat. Merit. et Remiſſ.</hi>
                  </note> And againe, <hi>Omnes eramus ille vnus Adam. i.</hi> We were all that one Adam. And the whole generation of mankind, is but <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Adams</hi> perſon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, or expounded at large: and may with as good propriety of ſpeech be called Adam, as the nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> is often in the Scripture called <hi>Iacob.</hi> So then it being granted, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> that the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was exceedingly ſinfull and demeritorious. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, that his perſon (properly taken) by reaſon of the ſcantneſſe or narrowneſſe of it, was not capable of the fulneſſe of that wrath, which that ſin deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and which it ſtood beſt with the glory of <hi>God,</hi> ſhould be executed or poured out upon it: it cannot be thought any waies unrighteous or unequall, that his poſteritie ſhould be arreſted alſo, and taken into Communion with his perſon in the puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, to ſupplie that which was wanting in it. That <hi>God</hi> ſhould not be ſtinted or ſtreightned in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſion for his owne glory in the puniſhment of ſin, but that he ſhould puniſh till he maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe whole, at leaſt till he cometh as neere into his owne, as conveniently he may, there is no man can judge unequall or unjuſt. Now then <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the ſinner, having of his owne, whereof or wherewith to make ſatisfaction, I meane a poſterity, which was ſo fully, ſo intirely, and (as I may ſay) ſo identically his owne, that it was as yet rather himſelfe then his; it cannot but be thought equall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:112049:130"/>and meet, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould father ſeize upon theſe, to doe himſelfe right, then upon the Angells or any other kind of creature that had not that neere and ſpeciall relation to the tranſgreſſor. As in the caſe of the ſinne of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> (and ſo of <hi>Achan</hi>) before mentioned, the perſonall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the offenders not holding out proportion with the nature and quality of their offences: there is no man but muſt needs conceive it more agreeable to juſtice, that their owne families reſpectively, and thoſe that had the neereſt relation to them, ſhould be taken to make up the exemplarineſſe of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till it was increaſed and raiſed to the line and levell of the offence, then any other family or perſon, that ſtood at a further diſtance from them. <hi>God,</hi> in a faire and reaſonable conſtruction, involving Adam and his poſterity in the puniſhment for his ſinne, did but involve Adam himſelfe, or his perſon only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his perſon and poſterity, when this puniſhment was executed, were but one and the ſame Adam. This is the third and laſt particular, upon which the equitie of <hi>God,</hi> in puniſhing aſwell Adams poſterity, as his perſon, for his ſinne, ſeemes to be grounded, <hi>viz.</hi> the peculiar neereneſſe and relation betweene his perſon and poſteritie.</p>
               <p>Me thinks there is a joynt intimation of all the three, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>14</label> in that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Wherfore as by one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, in that</hi> (or rather, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt tranſlations and expoſitions, <hi>in whom) all men have ſinned.</hi> Here is firſt the demerit of this ſin implied, in that <hi>death</hi> is ſaid <hi>to enter into the world by it.</hi> There is nothing in ſinne to draw death and condemnation after it, but only the demerit or ſinfulneſſe of it: as for the act it ſelfe, whereunto this ſinfullneſſe cleaveth (for <hi>malum ſemper habitat in ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eno

               <p>Secondly, it being further ſaid, that <hi>death being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, paſsed</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>upon all men,</hi> or <hi>over all men,</hi> it ſheweth, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was not ſufficient or able to beare the fullnes of that puniſhment, which the ſinfullneſſe-of his ſin had deſerved: otherwiſe <hi>death</hi> (doubtleſſe) would have ſtopp'd there, and have gone, or paſſed on no further.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, where it is added in the cloſe, as the reaſon why <hi>death,</hi> being gotten into the world, ſhould paſſe directly towards men, and ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile (in ſpeciall manner) over them, and that over them all (without exception) <hi>viz. becauſe that in him,</hi> i. <hi>Adam, all men had ſinned:</hi> this implieth, that had not men bin in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or otherwiſe had no ſpeciall or neere relation to him, this death had had no more right or advantage againſt them, then againſt other creatures.</p>

                  <hi>in whom all have ſinned</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi>) Therfore now the ground of that puniſhment or condemnation which is come upon all men, is not the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:112049:131"/>ſinne, much leſſe of the act of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne (as before we diſtinguiſhed, but if any <hi>imputation</hi> be in this caſe, it is of every mans owne ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> for it was not <hi>Adam</hi> alone that ſinned, but <hi>all ſinned</hi> in him it is every mans owne ſinne that is <hi>imputed</hi> to him, and for which he is puniſhed. As <hi>Levi</hi> himſelfe is ſaid to have paied tithes in the loynes of <hi>Abraham</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not that <hi>Abraham's</hi> paying of tithes was <hi>imputed</hi> to <hi>Levi, Heb.</hi> 7.9.10. ſo neither is it to be ſaid, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne is <hi>imputed</hi> to his poſterity, but rather that this poſteritie themſelves ſinned in <hi>Adam;</hi> and it is but every mans own ſin, not <hi>Adams,</hi> that is <hi>imputed</hi> to him. To make a bare and diſtrict <hi>imputation</hi> of the act of anothers ſin, the adequate and ſole ground and foundation of that heavy judgement and puniſhment that is layed upon all men in this kind, is not ſo much to repreſent <hi>God</hi> to the minds and conſciences of men, as a diſtrict, juſt and ſevere Judge (which with their interpretations may be affirmed of him) as to make him ſo farre to take pleaſure, or to delight in blood, and in the ruine of his creature, that he will take occaſion, even where none is, to ſlay and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy with <hi>death</hi> And of the two (doubtleſſe) it were leſſe diſhonourable unto <hi>God,</hi> to conceive or ſay of him in this caſe, that he fell thus heavie in wrath and judgement upon the whole poſterity of Adam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would doe it, or becauſe it was his abſolute will and pleaſure ſo to doe: then to pretend or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bare <hi>imputation</hi> of the act of Adams ſin, the cauſe or reaſon of it. For in the former, the abſolute power or Soveraigntie of <hi>God</hi> over the creature, is plainly aſſerted (though perhaps in terms ſomwhat harder then many eares will well beare) but in the latter, there is only a cold and hungry pretence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to beare out one of the greateſt and moſt weighty acts of judgement that ever <hi>God</hi> exerciſed. Of the two it is leſſe diſhonourable to a Prince or
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:112049:131"/>Monarch, to profeſſe a power above <hi>Law,</hi> then to exerciſe it under a pretence of juſtice. And what is there more in the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, to make the puniſhment of it upon all his poſterity, an act of juſtice in <hi>God,</hi> or to eaſe the conceit of abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigntie, then if there were no ſuch <hi>imputation</hi> at all? Or ſuppoſe <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>repute</hi> me to have ſin'd in <hi>Adam,</hi> and becauſe he ſo <hi>reputeth</hi> me, ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement upon me; in caſe I did not ſo ſinne, as <hi>God reputeth</hi> me to have done, it had bin altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as much juſtice in <hi>God</hi> to have puniſhed me without any ſuch <hi>reputing</hi> me to have ſinned, as with it. But in caſe I did ſinne (as the Scripture teſtifieth to my face I did) now there is no neceſſity or occaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on why <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>impute</hi> Adams ſinne unto me, to make me capable of puniſhment: the <hi>imputation</hi> of this my owne ſinne is abundantly ſufficient. Beſides, ſuppoſe I could not be truly ſaid to have ſinned my ſelfe, being yet in the loynes of Adam, and ſo my owne ſinne not to be <hi>imputed</hi> unto me: yet my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Adam in his nature, or my neere rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, being one of his children and poſterity, upon the former ſuppoſition, that Adams ſin was not puniſhable to the height in the puniſhment of his perſon only, is a full and ſufficient ground to beare out the juſtice of <hi>God,</hi> in laying all that puniſhment upon me he hath done.

Hee that by his cattel, or otherwiſe, hath made ſpoile in his neighbours corne, and hath given him full ſatisfaction for the ſpoyle done to his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is as good a neighbour, and deales as juſtly and honeſtly with him, as he that never treſpaſſed in that kind upon him. The eſſence and nature of Juſtice or righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (in the ſenſe we now ſpeake of) is this (as the knowne definition gives it) <hi>Suum cutque tribuere;</hi> to give to every one his owne, <hi>i.</hi> that which in a way of equity and right is due from us unto them.

                  </note> The reaſon of this is evident: nothing can any way diminiſh or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the perfection of righteouſneſſe, but only ſin: as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder perfection of light, but darkeneſſe in one degree or other, or perfection of ſight, but blindnes in ſome degree or other. So that as the aire when it is free from all degrees of darkeneſſe muſt of neceſſitie be perfectly and fully light, and a man that is in no meaſure or degree blinde, muſt needs be perfectly ſighted: ſo he that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly freed from all ſinne whatſoever muſt of neceſſitie be compleately and perfectly righteous withall. It is unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conceive a man defective in any part or point of righteouſneſſe, and yet withall to conceive him free from all ſinne, ſinne and righteouſneſſe being <hi>in ſubjecto capaci contraria immediata,</hi> as <hi>Logicians</hi> ſpeak.

So that beſides that perfect remiſſion of ſinnes, which hath beene
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112049:135"/>purchaſed by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt for thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, there is no neede of (indeede no place for) the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any righteouſneſſe performed by Chriſt unto the Law, becauſe in that very act of remiſſion of ſinnes, there is included an imputation of a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: or to ſpeake more properly, and with Scripture exactneſſe, that act of God whereby he remitteth and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth ſinne, is interpretatively, nothing elſe but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puattion of a perfect righteouſneſſe or of a fulfilling of the Law. Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. ver. 6. with ver. 7. and 11. Even as that act of the Phyſition by which he recovereth his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient from his ſickneſſe, may with full proprietie of ſpeech be called that act, whereby he reſtoreth him to his health: this expreſſion were but a plaine interpretation of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and no more nor any thing elſe in ſubſtance, but it. And ſo that Act, by which the Sunne diſpells the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, may indifferently be called that act, by which hee fills the Aire with light. And as the Phyſitian doth not heale the diſeaſe by one act, and recover or reſtore health by another act, really differing from it, but doth both by one and the ſame act, healing the diſeaſe, and reſtoring, of health, being but two differing names or conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of one and the ſame thing; In like manner, God doth not heale ſinne, that is, forgive ſinne by one act, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the life of righteouſneſſe, that is, impute righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by another act at all differing from it, but in and by one and the ſame punctuall and preciſe act, hee doth the one and the other; forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and imputation of righteouſneſſe; being but two different names, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or conſiderations of one and the ſame thing.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112049:135"/>ſinnes: and againe, the imputing of righteouſneſſe, is ſometimes called the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, to ſhew that God hath no other righteouſneſſe to conferre upon a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that which ſtands in forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. So that theſe two termes or expreſſions; imputing righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and forgiving ſinne, do but aide and aſſiſt one the other towards a full explication of the nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of that act of God, which ſometimes goeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the one name, and ſometimes under the other.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That there is as expreſſe and compleate a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in the Law, as ever Chriſt himſelfe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: yea, a righteouſneſſe more proper, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all ſorts and conditions of men, than that perſonall righteouſneſſe which Chriſt himſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (as was ſhewed at large in the former part of this Treatiſe) And what if it be ſaid, that God, in remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins through Chriſt from and out of the Law im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth to every man that beleeveth, ſuch a righteouſneſſe as is proper to him? This I am certaine, is a thouſand times more agreeable both to reaſon and to the Scriptures, then to hold an imputation of ſuch a righteouſneſſe, that is, of ſuch a ſyſteme and frame of actions, which were indeed a righteouſneſſe to him that wrought them, the Law requiring them of him, but can be a righteouſneſſe to none other perſon whatſoever, the Law requiring the ſame acts for no man is therefore juſt or righteous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth the things which the Law ſimply requireth, but becauſe he doth thoſe things which the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of him, in reverence to his perſonall condition, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and relations in every kinde. A man may be as wicked and ſinfull by doing that which the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of another man, as by doing that which the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth unto all men.

                  </note> The Reaſon of this is evident alſo. Death is the wages of ſin, and of ſin only, being due to no creature in any other reſpect nor upon any other terme whatſoever: and therefore cannot in a way of ordinary juſtice be inflicted by God upon any creature, but for ſin.</p>
               <p>Now he that is free from death, and no wayes obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thereunto,
<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw</hi> Iuſtific. <hi>p.</hi> 79.</note> cannot but be conceived to have a right unto life, there being neither any middle condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene death and life, wherein it is poſſible for a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature to ſubſiſt, nor againe any capacity of life, but by ſome right and title thereunto. <hi>Adam</hi> whilſt his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and he ſtood together, and whilſt he was free from ſinne, had a right and title unto life, yea, and had the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and fruition of it given unto him; (for how could he be threatned with death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. who was not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſſed of life) though he had not yet performed the Law; either by himſelfe or any other for him, in any ſuch ſence as is contended for by ſome, as of abſolute neceſſitie to give a right and title unto life: and if he had not a right unto life by his freedome from ſinne, but was to purchaſe this right by an actuall fulfilling of the Law, it would be known, what quantities of obedience to the Law hee muſt have paid, before he had made this purchaſe, and how long he muſt have obeyed and kept the Law, before this right and title unto life would have accru'd unto him. For had he lived a 1000. yeares in his integritie and uprightneſſe without the leaſt touch of any tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he had ſtill bin a debtor of obedience to the Law, upon the ſame termes that he was at the beginning, and the leaſt interruption or breach in the courſe of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112049:136"/>had even now beene the forfeiture of that life hee enjoyed. So then this poſition alſo is unqueſtionably true, that there needs no other righteouſneſſe, but onely the forgiveneſſe of, or freedome from ſinne, to give a man a cleare and lawfull title unto life.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Scriptures of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeme to place the immediate right or capacitie which beleevers have to the Kingdome of heaven, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall glory, rather in the grace of Adoption or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip vouchſafed by God unto them through Jeſus Chriſt, then in any righteouſneſſe whatſoever (even remiſſion of ſinnes it ſelfe not excepted, (as was proved more at large in the 12th. Chapter of the former part of this Treatiſe. The reaſon whereof may (haply) be this: becauſe the life and bleſſedneſſe which come by Jeſus Chriſt to the world through Faith, are of a farre higher nature, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and worth, than that life which was covenanted by God with <hi>Adam,</hi> by way of wages for his worke, or obedience to the Law; and therefore require a higher, and fuller, and richer capacity or title in the creature, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe him therein, than that did.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112049:137"/>where there is ſatisfaction; there is, and may be remiſſion. Now that that obedience or ſubjection which Chriſt exhibited to the morall Law, was no wayes penall to him, is evident from hence: Penall to him in reſpect of his Godhead it could not be, the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being no wayes paſſive in it ſelfe, nor capable of puniſhment. Againe, in reſpect of his humane nature, this obedience could not be penall, becauſe it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of man in his innocency, and impoſed by God upon <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall: yea, and ſtill lieth, and ſhall he to the dayes of eternity, upon men and Angels, yea and upon Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe in their glorified conditions. Love (which the Apoſtle affirmeth to be the fulfilling or keeping of the Law) never falleth away. Therefore to make obedience to the morall Law, penall, is to affirme, that man was puniſhed; and that by order and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God before his fall, or before hee ſinned, and that the glorified Saints and Angels, yea and Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe are now puniſhed in heaven.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>9</label> doth no wayes require or ſuppoſe any ſuch imputation of his righteouſneſſe unto them, as is conceived. That Vnion and Communion which the wife hath with the husband, doth not require, that whatſoever the husband hath ſhould be imputed to the wife, or that the wife ſhould be reputed to have whatſoever the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath. The wife is not reputed wiſe, becauſe the husband is wiſe, ſhe may be weake and ſimple notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and juſtly ſo reputed to be: neither is the hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie or faithfulneſſe of the husband in marriage ſo imputed to the wife, and therefore ſhe muſt be reputed faithfull and honeſt in the ſame kinde. The wife may be looſe and falſe, and deſervedly ſo eſteemed by all men, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her union and communion with an husband, of upright affections, neither doth the union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which the reſt of the members of the body have with the head, neceſſarily require, that whatſoever the Head hath or doth, ſhould be imputed to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers reſpectively. The eyes which are in the head, are not imputed to the hands or feete, nor the eares which grow upon the head, imputed to the heeles, nor the actions or naturall functions of ſeeing and hearing, the one perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the eyes, the other by the eares, imputed to the armes or legges, ſo that theſe ſhould be ſaid either to ſee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112049:138"/>or to heare as they doe. In like manner there is not the leaſt ſhew or colour of pretence, to build a neceſſity of the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to beleevers, upon that union and communion which they have with him, or to conclude and inferre, that becauſe beleevers have union and communion with Chriſt, therefore his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe muſt be theirs in ſuch a ſence, that they may have the denomination of righteous therefrom, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and made righteous therewith. May it not be ſaid with as much reaſon, that becauſe beleevers have union and communion with Chriſt, therefore his ſoule and his body muſt needs be imputed to them, yea and his wiſedome, and his power, and his glory imputed to them alſo, ſo that they are eſteemed by God, as wiſe, as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as glorious by vertue of ſuch imputation, as Chriſt himſelfe is.</p>
               <p>That union and communion which beleevers have with Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>10</label> are ſufficiently, yea abundantly ſalved and made good in theſe and ſuch like particulars. 1. By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this union and communion with him, they are actuall members of that myſticall and bleſſed body or ſociety, whereof he is the head. 2. They are partakers of the ſame ſpirit with him who dwelleth in them, as he dwelleth in Chriſt himſelf. 3. They have communion &amp; fellowſhip in the ſame fruits and effects of the Spirit with him. 4. By vertue of this union and communion with him they have part and fellowſhip in that Redemption, which he hath purchaſed with his blood. 5. They have ſpeciall intereſt in that infinite wiſedome and power of his, as in all other perfections, and excellent endowments of his perſon, whereby he is both every wayes able, and alwayes ready and willing to doe marvellouſly for them, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the things of their peace. 6. they have a compleate right and title to that immortall and undefiled inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is reſerved in the heavens. 7. They have communion and fellowſhip with God himſelfe, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall intereſt in his love. 8. And laſtly, they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip one with another, and are deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deepely intereſſed in the mutuall affections one of another, beſides many other rich priviledges of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of very precious concernment. So that to deny
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112049:138"/>the imputation of Chriſts righteouſnes is no more to deny or any wayes to obſcure their union &amp; communion with Chriſt, than to deny that the miracles which Chriſt wrought are imputed to us, or than to deny that a man ſeeth with his hands, or healeth with his heeles, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that the members of the body have any connexion, union or communion, with the head.</p>
               <p>The ſinne in of <hi>Adam</hi> is no where in Scripture ſaid to be imputed to his poſterity: <label type="milestone">

But as for any ſuch imputation of it, by vertue whereof, preciſely conſidered, and ſimply as an act of Gods juſtice, all his poſterity ſhould be conſtituted and made formally ſinners, neither doe the Scriptures acknowledge, nor ſound reaſon admit. The former clauſe of this Concluſion is unqueſtionable. The Scriptures whereſoever they ſpeake of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and the relation of it to his poſterity, wholly abſtaine from the terme of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, neither doe they uſe any other word or phraſe in this Argument of like ſignification and importance with it, at leaſt in that notion and ſence, wherein it is ſo frequently uſed by many in this controverſie. But firſt, they acknowledge a communion betweene <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity (except the before excepted) in this ſin, in reſpect whereof, the ſinne may as well be attributed to any, and to all of his poſterity, as to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> act of paying tythes to <hi>Melchizedeth,</hi> is aſcribed to <hi>Levie</hi> being in his loynes, as well as to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe. <hi>And to ſay as the thing is</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>Levie alſo which receiveth tythes, paied tythes in Abraham.</hi> The truth and propriety of which ſaying, he makes good by this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in the next words. <hi>For he was yet in the loynes of his Father [Abraham] when Melchizedech met him.</hi> It is not here ſaid, that <hi>Abrahams paying tythes,</hi> was imputed to <hi>Levie,</hi> but that <hi>Levie</hi> himſelfe payed tythes (in that act of <hi>Abrahams</hi>) as well as <hi>Abraham.</hi> So that this act of paying tythes, was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112049:139"/>as well <hi>Levies</hi> act, as <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and is imputed to him not as <hi>Abrahams</hi> act, but as his owne. In like manner the Scripture plainely affirmeth, that all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity ſinn'd in <hi>Adam</hi> (in that firſt ſinne of his eſpecially) <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. but it no where affirmeth, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. Their owne ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> may with good propriety of ſpeech, and ſafety of truth, be ſaid to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them: but that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, otherwiſe than as it is or was theirs, as well as his, by reaſon of that ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and being they had in him or in his loynes, ſhould be imputed to them, hath neither ground in Scripture, nor conſiſtence either with reaſon or truth.</p>

                  <hi>Operatio rei conſequitur eſſe rei, i.</hi> the Acts or operations of things ſtill follow the being of things, and are proportionable and ſuteable thereunto, is ſound and rationall, and of perfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with that Scripture Reaſon, cited from <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.10. There are ſeverall kinds of beings and ſubſiſtences of things. A thing may have its being, <hi>either in cauſis,</hi> or <hi>extra cauſas, i.</hi> either in the cauſes of it onely, or out of the cauſes <hi>viz.</hi> when it is actually produced and in a compleate being. Againe, thoſe things that have their beings onely in their cauſes, may have their being either in their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall cauſes onely, as the counſell, purpoſe, and power of God; or in the naturall cauſes alſo, that is, when ſuch things have an actuall and compleate being, which according to the common courſe of nature and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are able and apt to produce them. Thus in Winter, the Roſe may be ſaid to have a being in the roote of that ſhrubbe that is apt to beare it in Summer, the naturall ſeaſon for ſuch births Thus <hi>Levie</hi> (as we heard) is ſaid to <hi>have beene, i.</hi> to have had a being, <hi>in the loynes of Abraham.</hi> And this all mankinde, even <hi>Adams</hi> whole poſterity, had a being and ſubſiſtence in <hi>Adam.</hi> Now there are none of theſe kinds of beings and ſubſiſtences of things, but have their acts and operations proportionable and proper to them; the perfecter being, the perfecter and leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent operation. Things that have an actuall and compleate being out of their cauſes, act, and worke of themſelves, their cauſes that produced them, as ſuch, having no communion or fellowſhip with them
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112049:139"/>in their actions: Things that have their beings onely in their cauſes, act and operate in, and by, and with theſe onely, as having their whole dependence on them, and ſubſiſtence in them, yet are theſe acts and operations of things in their cauſes onely, as truely theirs, though not as perfectly and compleately theirs as they are the cauſes themſelves, in and by whom they were performed. Thus <hi>Levie</hi> did as truely pay tythes in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did, in whom he paied them, otherwiſe wee make the Scripture leſſe true, in affirming the one, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that act of eating the forbidden fruit by <hi>Adam,</hi> was as truely the act of all his poſterity, as his owne, though not ſo compleately and perfectly theirs, as his, hee having no dependance on them, or ſubſiſtence in any of them therein, but they all depending on him, as one in and by whom God had given them all their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and having their ſubſiſtence in him, as the naturall productive roote of all their actuall &amp; compleate beings.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne comes to relate or to have reference to his poſteritie, in matter of pollution and defilement, and conſequently of guilt and puniſhment by naturall deſcent and propagation from him. <hi>Adams</hi> perſon, the fountaine and ſpring-head of all his poſteritie, being corrupted and poyſoned with him, except God ſhould have wrought miraculouſly and above the courſe of nature, either by a through purging of the fountaine, before any ſtreame iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued from it, or by diſſevering and untwiſting (as it were) the poyſon from the waters, in the very point and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iſſue and ſource (neither of which he was any wayes bound to doe) could not but ſend forth ſtreames of like corruption and defilement with the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it ſelfe.

               <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) death and condemnation are juſtly come upon the world, no ſo much (to ſpeake properly, and with the Scriptures) for <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, as by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, partly as this tranſgreſſion of his was the ſinne and tranſgreſſion of the world (as hath beene already ſaid and proved) partly as by meanes of this ſin, the world, I meane all the ſonnes and daughters of men that are borne into it, are become perſonally (and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleately ſinfull.

The Apoſtle himſelfe gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:112049:140"/>in two particulars wherein they differ greatly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15.16. And beſides theſe, there are many others. As firſt, the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> by which he brought condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the world, was as well the act of all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie as his owne, in which reſpect they may as truely be ſaid to have brought condemnation upon themſelves, as <hi>Adam,</hi> but that obedience, by which Chriſt brought ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation into the world, can with no propriety of ſpeech, nor with any conſiſtence of truth, be ſaid to have beene theirs, or performed by them, who are ſaved by it, ſo that theſe cannot now be ſaid with any more truth to have ſaved themſelves, then if they had not beene ſaved at all. It is ſaid indeede, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. But it is no where ſaid, that the world was in Chriſt reconciling it ſelfe unto God. 2. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> by his ſinne brought condemnation upon thoſe who were in his loynes, and had a naturall being in him: but Chriſt by his obedience brought ſalvation unto them, that had no ſuch relation to him, nor any being or ſubſiſtance in him, either naturall or ſpirituall (which is by faith) but were wholly aliens and ſtrangers from him, yea and enemies to him. 3. All thoſe that are condemned by <hi>Adam</hi> had their being in him altogether, at one and the ſame time. <hi>Caine</hi> was not in <hi>Adam,</hi> before <hi>Iudas,</hi> nor <hi>Iudas</hi> after <hi>Caine,</hi> but amongſt thoſe that are ſaved by Chriſt; there is an order and difference of time in reſpect of their ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing into him: ſome are ſooner, and ſome later in him. <hi>Andronicus,</hi> and <hi>Iunia Pauls</hi> Cozens, were in Chriſt before him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. 4. That diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> by which he brought condemnation upon the world, was active: but that obedience by which Chriſt brings ſalvation to the world, is paſſive, as hath beene already proved, and may further appeare by comparing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. &amp;c. 5. And laſtly, the whole weight of the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation of the world by Chriſt, depended upon the merit and ſatisfactorineſſe of that obedience of his by which it was procured, and not at all upon any relation of thoſe to him or ſeminall involution or comprehenſion in him, for whom it was procured but the burthen of the condemnation comming by the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> depended not onely (or not ſo much) upon the demerit,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112049:141"/>or offenſiveneſſe of the tranſgreſſion but upon the relation of thoſe to him who were condemned by him, as having a true naturall and ſeminall being in him or in his loynes, when he tranſgreſſed. So that though the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> had bin of an inferior nature and of leſſe demerit &amp; provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſight of God than it was, yet might <hi>Adams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie juſtly have bin involv'd in the ſame condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it, wherein now it is, but if the obedience or ſufferings of Chriſt had beene of leſſe value, merit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation or ſatisfaction then they were, the redemption and ſalvation of the world, could not have beene carried out, or obtained by them.</p>
               <p>Hence the different manner of the Scriptures ſpeaking of the one and of the other, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>15</label> is very conſiderable, when it ſpeakes of the Redemption or Iuſtification by Chriſt, it ſometimes uſeth an expreſſion, importing the worth, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or acceptation of Chriſt in his ſufferings, as where God is ſaid for Chriſts ſake to have forgiven us our ſins, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. But when it ſpeaketh of the condemnation of the world by <hi>Adam,</hi> it no where ſaith, that God for <hi>Adams</hi> ſake, ſubjected the world to death and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but only thus, <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſin, Rom.</hi> 5.12. And againe, <hi>through the offence of one many are dead, ver.</hi> 15. Againe, <hi>By one mans offence death reigned by one,</hi> ver. 17. with many the like, ſtill uſing termes and expreſſions, which doe not neceſſarily import the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> to have beene the meritorious or deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe, (though this be not denied) but rather the inſtrumentall and mediating cauſe ſimply of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. It is true, the vertue and efficacie of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience of Chriſt it ſelfe, whereby the ſalvation of the world is purchaſed, is many times expreſſed by the fame propoſitions or particles of ſpeech, <hi>By,</hi> and <hi>Through,</hi> as <hi>Rom</hi> 5.11. <hi>By him we have received the attonement, &amp;c.</hi> but there is nothing more frequent in the Scriptures then to ſpeake that ſparingly, and in generall termes onely in one place, which it ſpeaketh fully, and with exactneſſe, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But when it uſeth expreſſions conſtantly of one and the ſame line and importance, and never riſeth higher, there can be no ground from the Scriptures, of conceiving any thing above or beyond ſuch expreſſions,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112049:141"/>in any ſubject; as on the other hand, when we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that are richer and fuller, and more diſtinct in any place, we are not to meaſure or confine our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and underſtandings of things to thoſe that are lower and more generall. As in the caſe in hand, the more frequent expreſſions are, that, by Chriſt, or through Chriſt, and ſo by his blood, or thorough his blood, &amp;c. we have Redemption, or Remiſſion of ſinnes: yet muſt we not from hence conclude, that therefore Chriſt, or his blood are barely an inſtrumentall cauſe or meanes of Redemption, and have nothing of merit in them, becauſe theſe particles, by and through, uſually ſignifie an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall efficiencie, and no more: the reaſon is, becauſe the Scripture elſewhere ſupplieth that which is wanting in ſuch expreſſions as theſe, and repreſents to us that ſpeciall and peculiar kinde of efficiencie, which we call meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Chriſt and his ſufferings. And had it bin ſimply the demerit or offenſiveneſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin that had brought the judgement or condemnation upon his poſterity, there can hardly any reaſon be given, why the ſin of the Angels that fell, ſhould not have brought the like judgement and condemnation upon their whole creation: becauſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſin of theſe Angels, was every whit as demeritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and full of provocation, as the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was.</p>

So that what he hath purpoſely, and with all his might done for the juſtification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, muſt needs be of an incomparable farre greater efficacie to carry theſe before it, then the ſtumbling, or unadviſed ſinne of one poore, meere, and meane man (in compariſon) can be to procure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of it.</p>
               <p>Onely I deſire that it ſhould be here conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that there is nothing ſaid in all this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, any wayes to extenuate, either the demerit or guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, beneath their juſt proportions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but onely to ſhew, that there is a great exceſſe of merit in the obedience of Chriſt, above the rate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of demerit in the diſobedience of <hi>Adam.</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112049:143"/>to it, whether deſcent, propertie or act, but ſomewhat that is extrinſecall, and purely adventitious, <hi>viz.</hi> the force and efficacie of that will, good pleaſure, ordination, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and appointment of God in that behalfe. As it was neither the ſtature nor comelineſſe of <hi>Aarons</hi> perſon, nor his deſcent from <hi>Levie,</hi> nor his grace, nor his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor his knowledge, nor any ſervice formerly done by him, either unto God, or his Church, nor any thing that in any proprietie of ſpeech could be called his, that made him an high Prieſt, but Gods calling him unto, and inveſting him with that honour and function; he might have beene all that hee was otherwiſe, and might have done all that hee did otherwiſe, and yet without this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing and appointment from God, another might have beene high Prieſt, and not he: So might Faith have beene Faith, both in the Originall and deſcent of it from the Spirit of God, as likewiſe in all that native beautie and excellencie that belongs to it, yea and put forth all thoſe acts, which otherwiſe it puts forth, as to bring men to Chriſt, to lay hold of Chriſt, &amp;c. and yet never have attained the honour that is now put upon it, never have beene inſtrumentall in Juſtification. And as the ſame anointing or calling from God, which were confer'd upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> would have made any other man Prieſt, though of another Tribe, though leſſe gracefull of perſon, of meaner gifts and abilities every-wayes than <hi>Aaron</hi> was, had they beene conferred upon him; ſo had any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace, as love, patience, temperance, or the like, the force and power of the ſame covenant or ordination from God to aſſiſt them, it cannot be conceived, but that any of theſe would juſtifie as effectually, as faith it ſelfe now doth. Therefore it is unqueſtionably evident, that Faith doth not juſtifie, as it relates to Chriſt or as it apprehends him, or redemption by him, or the like, becauſe all theſe, and ſuch like properties or acts as theſe are eſſentiall and naturall unto Faith (I meane to ſuch a Faith as we ſpeake of) and that Faith which hath not, or doth not all this, is no true, lively, or effectuall Faith, or inſtrumentall in juſtification: Wherefore, if Faith ſhould juſtifie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, or by vertue of any of theſe, it ſhould juſtifie by it ſelfe, or by ſome dignity, quality, or act that is proper to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112049:143"/>it, or inherent in it. Hence it is that Scripture ſtill ſuſpends the juſtifying power or propertie of Faith, upon the will, free grace, and good pleaſure of God, but never upon any act or qualitie proper to it ſelfe. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.40.) <hi>that every man that ſeeth the Sonne, and beleeveth in him ſhould have everlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> clearely implying. 1. That it is not any ſeeing of Chriſt, either corporally or ſpiritually, nor any beleeving in him that could carry eternall life, had it not the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the will of God to ſtrengthen it thereunto. And 2 that had this Will of God fallen in conjunction with any other grace, or act of grace beſides Faith they would have carried eternall life; after the ſame manner, and with as high an hand, as beleeving now doth. <hi>Naamans</hi> leproſie was cureable onely by the waters of <hi>Iordan,</hi> why? becauſe the will and decree of God concerning this effect were upon theſe waters, and upon theſe onely; <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Pharpar,</hi> or any other River whatſoever would have done as much, had the ſame decree of God concurred with them. When cauſes have an intrinſecall and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power and efficacie to produce their effects, it is very improper (if not ridiculous) to aſcribe ſuch effects to the will and good pleaſure of God. As to ſay it is the will of God, that the grace of patience ſhould make a man pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or the grace of humility, ſhould make a man hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or that ſuch an element as we call fire, ſhould burne, or the like, though there be a truth in them; yet there is ſo little ſavour or weight of truth in them, that ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not worthy the holy Ghoſt, and neither theſe nor any of their fellowes of like importance to be found in the whole Booke of God. So to ſay, that it is the Will of God, that beleeving in Chriſt ſhould juſtifie, and ſo ſave men, if beleeving in Chriſt ſimply as it is beleeving in Chriſt did it, were an eccentricall expreſſion, and no where to be parallell'd in the Scriptures, I might adde many other Scriptures, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. where it is ſaid, that <hi>to thoſe that received Chriſt, i.</hi> that beleeved in him, <hi>God gave the power or prerogative to be his Sonnes, i.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that ſuch ſhould be Sonnes unto him, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſuch a decree, really made them ſuch upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving; which clearely ſhewes, that beleeving in Chriſt,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112049:144"/>as ſuch, doth not make a Son of God, but receives this power or prerogative by eſpeciall guift from God: which gift might have beene given to any other grace, as well as beleeving. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. By grace ye are ſaved, through Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> in Chriſt: therefore Faith doth not ſave ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as, or becauſe Chriſt is the object of it, but by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie and force of that gracious and good pleaſure of God whereby he hath covenanted with his creature that ſuch a Faith ſhall ſave it; which good pleaſure or Covenant of God with men concerning Faith, is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>the Law of Faith</hi> which Law is that which gives it that ſtrength and power which it now hath, to juſtifie and ſave. It were eaſie to make this pile of Scriptures large: but thoſe that have beene touched, are ſufficient to ſhew which way they generally incline in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p>Neither is that common plea, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>18</label> which is ſo frequently inſiſted upon, to prove the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that Faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in relation to its object, or as it receiveth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth Chriſt, or Chriſts righteouſneſſe, or the like, of any value, if it be duely conſidered. The ſtrength of the argument is uſually bound up in this ſimilitude. As the hand is ſaid to enrich a man, becauſe it receives the money or treaſure, whereby he is inriched; ſo Faith muſt needs be ſaid to juſtifie, becauſe it receives Chriſt, who is our righteouſneſſe, and by whom we are juſtified. To this I anſwer, that it is not ſimply the taking ſilver or gold with the hand, that enricheth a man, no nor the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or gold ſo taken, that ſimply enricheth him. A man may be never the richer for receiving great ſummes of money of ſilver and gold; nay, a man may be much the poorer and more miſerable for receiving or taking mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, if he receives or takes it contrary to the Lawes: As when a thiefe breakes into an houſe, and takes away much treaſure with him, or puts forth his hand to take a mans purſe by the high-wayes ſide; his hand in theſe caſes cannot be ſaid to make him rich becauſe it receives treaſure: neither doth the treaſure ſo received make him rich, but poore and miſerable, becauſe now he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the ſentence of the Law, and ownes his life and all he is worth beſides, unto it. Therefore if a mans
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112049:144"/>hand enricheth him by receiving that which doth enrich him, it doth it not ſimply as it receiveth it (for then it ſhould doe it alwayes, and in all caſes whatſoever) but it doth it by vertue of that Law, or agreement of the ſtate where he lives, which ſecureth a man in the quiet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and enjoyment, of ſuch money or treaſure, as hee lawfully receives to his owne uſe. So, though Chriſt be a treaſure of righteouſneſſe and juſtification in himſelfe it doth not preſently follow, that whoſoever takes hold on him, or beleeves in him, ſhould preſently be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, or juſtified by him: but here muſt intervene ſome Law, Covenant, or Decree from God, to eſtabliſh and authorize ſuch a beleeving or laying hold on him to be a mans righteouſneſſe or juſtification. Wee doe not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they can, but for argument ſake we will ſuppoſe, that if the Devills ſhould beleeve on Chriſt, hoping, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be juſtified by him as men doe, who beleeving are juſtified, yet they ſhould be never the nearer any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by him, though he be a treaſure of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Why? becauſe God hath made no Law, Promiſe, Covenant, or agreement with them, that they ſhould be juſtified by Faith: therefore if it were poſſible for them to beleeve as men doe, yet Chriſt would be no more any righteouſneſſe unto them than now he is.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid (and may be ſaid elſewhere) for the evidencing of this Concluſion: but here I would haſten. In the meane time I deſire to explaine my ſelfe a little further; touching this Concluſion, onely in two words. When I denie that Faith juſtifieth in its relation to its object, or as it layeth hold on Chriſt; I am farre from ſaying, or conceiving that any Faith ſhould juſtifie, but that onely which layeth hold on Chriſt; yea, I grant, and verily beleeve, that whereas there are many other acts of Faith beſides beleeving or laying hold on Chriſt, as <hi>viz.</hi> to comfort and ſtrengthen and purifie the hearts of thoſe that beleeve, and the like, yet that decree or good pleaſure of God, which (I conceive makes Faith juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, concurres with it towards this great effect, onely in that act of laying hold on Chriſt, and not in any of the other. So, that in this ſence, I grant &amp; hold that Faith may be ſaid to juſtifie, as it layeth hold of Chriſt comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112049:145"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> as this act of Faith is diſtinguiſhed, from thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts, which it likewiſe produceth; it doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, either as it comforts, or as it purifies the heart, &amp;c. but onely as it relateth to Chriſt, and layeth hold on him. This onely is that which I deny, that this act of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it receiveth or layeth hold on Chriſt, hath that in the nature, or inherently in it, or any otherwiſe, or by any other meanes, then from the will and good pleaſure of God, which makes it availeable unto juſtification.</p>
               <p>It hath no foundation, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Concluſ. </seg>12</label> either in the Scriptures or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſay, <label type="milestone">

And in another place, Chriſt was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo farre to take our ſinnes upon him, not as to be made a ſinner hereby, but [onely] a ſacrifice for ſinne. So that if the men with whom wee have to doe in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of imputation, would but ſtand their owne ground, and walke peaceably with their owne principles, wee ſhould ſoone comprimize.

               <p>Faith doth not onely (if at all declare a man to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:112049:145"/>or in a juſtified eſtate, but is the very meanes by which Juſtification or righteouſneſſe is obtained, ſo that no man is to be reputed (nor indeede is) a perſon juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God (ſpecially if we ſpeake of yeares of diſcretion) untill hee obtaines this grace of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by beleeving. This is the conſtant Doctrine of the Scriptures: and there is not one of many of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Divines that doe oppoſe it. <hi>He that beleeveth not</hi> (ſaith our Saviour himſelfe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16.) <hi>ſhall be damned.</hi> If Juſtification were in order of time before faith, it might very poſſibly be that many might eſcape damnation, who yet never beleeved, becauſe they might die in that interim of time, which is ſuppoſed to lie betweene a mans juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and his beleeving. The like argument might be framed from that paſſage alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.24. <hi>Except you beleeve that I am he, you ſhall die in your ſinnes.</hi> But there are other texts of Scripture ſo pregnant for this truth, that there is no riſing up with reaſon againſt them. Therfore we conclude (ſaith the Apoſtle) that a man is juſtified by Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the works of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. That which hee had laboured hitherto, and laboureth on in ſome Chapters following, to prove, was not how, or by what meanes a man might know, or be declared, either to himſelfe or others that he is a juſtified perſon, but how and by what meanes he might come to be juſtified. Theſe two are of a very farre differing conſideration and importance. It is of a thouſand times more concernement to a man to be juſtified, than to know that he is juſtified. Beſides, if the Apoſtles ſcope and intent here had beene to argue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, or to propound the meanes of a diſcovery or manifeſtation of a perſon juſtified, and not ſimply to prove and ſhew, how and by what meanes juſtification it ſelfe is to be attained, there can no reaſon be given, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther why he ſhould have excluded the workes of the Law, or inſiſted upon Faith, rather than many other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as love, patience, &amp;c. eſpecially why he ſhould have inſiſted on Faith onely; without the aſſociation of other graces. For it is certaine, that obedience to the Law, and ſo love, patience, temperance, humilitie, &amp;c. are as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, nay, have a preheminence above Faith it ſelfe, for the diſcovery of a man in the eſtate of Juſtification. <hi>Shew
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112049:146"/>me thy faith by thy workes, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes, Iam.</hi> 2.18. Therefore workes are more eaſie to be ſeene, and more apt for diſcovery or manifeſtation, then Faith: for that which diſcovereth or maketh things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, is light (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.13.) whereas that which needs manifeſtation, is darkeneſſe in (compariſon) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more unfit and uncapable of being a meanes for the diſcovery and manifeſtation of other things. So elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, love is repreſented as a grace of ſpeciall uſe and ſervice this way, I meane for the diſcovery and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of juſtification, or of a man in a juſtified condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is never mentioned, as of any uſe for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelfe. <hi>Wee know that we have paſſed from death to life becauſe we love the brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14.) The Scripture doth not any where aſcribe the like diſcoverie of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, unto Faith: but juſtification it ſelfe it aſcribeth unto Faith againe and againe. <hi>Therefore being juſtified by Faith, &amp;c.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>21</label> paſſing over many places; wherein Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication it ſelfe, not the diſcovery of Juſtification, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto Faith, and conclude with that one teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16, <hi>We knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, Even we have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Ieſus Chriſt, that wee might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, &amp;c. not becauſe we were righteous or juſtified, or that we might know our ſelves to be juſtified, but that we might be juſtified by the faith of Ieſus.</hi> If the Apoſtle ſhould here ſpeak of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative juſtification, there is no relation why he ſhould have excluded the workes of the Law, theſe being every whit of as declarative an importance this way, as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it ſelfe, nay, above it (as we proved before) and the Scripture it ſelfe plainely intimates: <hi>Little children</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iohn) let no man deceive you, He that doth righteouſneſſe is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, &amp;c. i.</hi> is thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> by his doing righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112049:146"/>declared to be righteous or a perſon juſtified: it is no where ſaid in ſuch a ſence, that he that beleeveth, is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. Therefore it is evident, that the oppoſition which this Apoſtle ſtill makes betweene the works of the Law, and beleeving, in the point of juſtification, is not at all in reſpect of the notification or diſcovery of it, either to the juſtified themſelves or others, but ſimply and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of the effecting it. Beſides, to make <hi>Paul</hi> ſay thus, that they had beleeved in Chriſt, that they might know that they had beene juſtified by beleeving in him, is to make him ſpeake at a very low rate of reaſon, and underſtanding, and not much ſhort of contradictions. For with what tolerable congruity or conſtruction of reaſon, can a man be ſaid, to beleeve with this intent, or for this end, that hee may know he is juſtified by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving? The doing of a thing for a certaine end, is no meanes to certifie, or aſſure any man, that the end is, or ſhall be, much leſſe that it hath already beene obtained, by the doing it. Much more might be argued both from the Scriptures, and reaſon, and teſtimony of Authors for this Concluſion, if it were either neceſſary or ſeaſonable in this place.</p>
               <p>Neither are the things that can be objected againſt it, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>22</label> of any ſuch weight, but that they may receive a faire and ready anſwer. I have heard onely of two Arguments that are made againſt it. The firſt is this, If a man muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, before he be juſtified, then God doth not juſtifie the ungodly, becauſe he that beleeveth cannot be counted an ungodly man. To this I anſwer in few words, that when the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>God juſtifieth the ungodly,</hi> the meaning is not as if the perſon to be juſtified muſt needs be ungodly, <hi>i</hi> in the midſt of his prophaneneſſe, in the very nicke and inſtant of time, wherein God juſtifieth him. But God may be ſaid to be he that juſtifieth the ungodly, becauſe he hath found out a way and meanes whereby to juftifie ſinners and ungodly men, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, which neither the Law knoweth, nor could ever the wiſedome of men or Angels have imagined. The juſtification of the ungodly is aſcribed unto God, as an high and excellent <hi>clogium</hi> of his wiſedome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; as when Chriſt is ſaid to ſave ſinners, the meaning
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112049:147"/>is not, that men are actually wicked and ſinfull, when ſalvation is actually conferr'd upon them, but that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords meanes to thoſe that are ſinners, as <hi>viz.</hi> the grace of Faith, Repentance, &amp;c. whereby they may be (and many are) ſaved.</p>
               <p>Or elſe ſecondly Anſwer might be, that God may be ſaid to juſtifie, not onely when hee abſolves and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the act or worke of juſtification <hi>i.</hi> when hee paſſeth a ſentence of abſolution upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, but even when hee beginneth it, <hi>i.</hi> when he firſt toucheth, moveth, or incline the heart to beleeve, upon which juſtification properly ſo called, dependeth and followeth immediatly. Now before and untill this ſupernaturall touch or motion of the heart from God, a man in ſtrictneſſe and proprietie of ſpeech may be called, <hi>ungodly.</hi> It is a common rule among Divines for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of many Scriptures: <hi>In Scripturis, ſaepe fieri di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur, quod fieri incipit.</hi> In Scripture that is often ſaid to be done, which is onely begun to be done, and whereof the cauſe onely is yet in being. Thus <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.2. Shame is ſaid to come, when pride commeth, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe pride is the cauſe of ſhame; and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. God is ſaid to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved men, when he hath conferred regeneration, or the waſhing of the new birth upon them, becauſe regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a meanes of ſalvation; beſides many like inſtances that might be added. In like manner juſtification may be ſaid to come, when Faith commeth; and God may be ſaid to juſtifie, when he giveth men Faith, whereby they ſhall be juſtified, &amp;c. In this ſence therefore God may be ſaid to juſtifie the <hi>ungodly,</hi> becauſe he giveth Faith unto men being yet ſinfull, whereby they are juſtified.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly) Further anſwer might be, that there being no prioritie of time at all but onely of nature between a mans beleeving and his being juſtified; ſo that in the very firſt inſtant and touch of time wherein he can be conceived truely to beleeve, he is to be conceived ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified alſo; God may as properly be ſaid to juſtifie the ungodly, though he juſtifieth onely thoſe that beleeve, as to give Faith, or the grace of beleeving unto the ungodly. The reaſon is plaine, becauſe in reſpect of time, a man is as immediately ungodly before his juſtification, as he is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112049:147"/>before his beleeving, though he be not juſtified, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>23</label> till hee beleeveth.</p>
               <p>The later Objections againſt the Concluſion in hand, is, if a man hath the Spirit of God given him, before hee beleeveth, he muſt needs be juſtified before he beleeveth: otherwiſe it muſt be ſaid, that a man may have the Spirit of grace and ſanctification, and yet be in an eſtate of wrath and condemnation. And that a man hath, and muſt have the Spirit of Grace before hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, it is evident, becauſe otherwiſe he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, firſt, by conceſſion, that a man is not able of himſelfe, and without the ſpeciall preſence and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of grace, to raiſe an act of a true beleeving in his ſoule.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, by way of exception, I anſwer two things, firſt, that though a man cannot beleeve, without the gracious aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, yet doth it not follow from hence, that there ſhould be the leaſt imaginable diſtance, or ſpace of time, betweene a mans receiving the Spirit, and his beleeving, wherein hee ſhould remayne liable to condemnation, becauſe the firſt touch of the Spirit upon the ſoule, &amp; the act of beleeving, may be, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſticke as faſt and cloſe together in reſpect of time, as the ſcales of <hi>Leviathan</hi> doe in reſpect of place, which (by the deſcription and teſtimony of God himſelfe, who beſt knowes their compoſure and frame) are ſo neere one to another, that no ayre can come between, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 41.16. The Sunne was not firſt made, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhined: but his ſhining in reſpect of time, is as ancient as his creation, there was not the leaſt diſtance or ſpace of time betweene, wherein any thing could be done, or the leaſt motion performed. So may the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Spirit of Grace unto the ſoule, and the act of the ſoules beleeving, touch in one and the ſame point of time (an infinit power being able to worke any thing in a moment) in which caſe it is evident, that there is no place for the inconvenience mentioned in the objection, <hi>viz.</hi> that a man endued with the ſpirit of grace ſhould for a time be in an eſtate of condemnation, except hee were juſtified before he beleeveth.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:112049:148"/>
               <p n="2">2. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>24</label> Be it ſuppoſed that the ſpirit of grace ſhould be at worke in the ſoule for any ſpace of time before the ſoule hath put forth an act of true beleeving, yet till there be a ſaving worke of Faith wrought by him in the ſoule, it is no wayes inconvenient nor contrary to truth, to judge the perſon in an eſtate of condemnation, though he may be comming on in a way towards juſtification. As men that never come to be juſtified, but periſh in their ſinnes everlaſtingly, are ſaid to be partakers of the holy Ghoſt, (<hi>Heb</hi> 6.4.) that is, may have many great and excellent workings of the holy Ghoſt within them, and upon them; ſo may men to whom the grace of juſtification (and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon it) is intended by God, have the like work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit upon them for a time, and yet have no worke at all upon them truely ſaving. <hi>i.</hi> which hath an eſſentiall and neceſſary connexion with ſalvation. And till ſome ſuch worke as this is wrought, though the Spirit of God be in them, yet are they under condemnation, and dying in their preſent condition, without ſomefurther worke of grace ſhould certainely periſh. Now though there may be many workings of the Spirit of God in men before they beleeve, which may be called <hi>Saving</hi> in regard of their iſſue and event; yet is there none formally ſaving, that is, that hath ſalvation promiſed unto it, till Faith it ſelfe be wrought. The firſt touch of any worke upon the ſoule, that is, either truly ſanctifying, or neceſſarily ſaving is that whereby the ſoule is inabled to touch upon Chriſt for its juſtification; neither is the habit of Faith firſt planted in the ſoule by the holy Ghoſt, and afterwards, the ſoule enabled by it, 'to exerciſe and put forth an act of beleeving whereby it, is juſtified: but as the common and more probable opinion is, that fruit-bearing trees, were at firſt created with ripe fruits upon them, ſo doth God at firſt create both the habit and act of faith in the ſoule in the ſame moment of time, and not the one before the other. So that the firſt act of beleeving whereby the creature is primarily juſtified, is not rais'd out of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent habit or grace of Faith, as all after acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving are, but is as immediately the product or effect of the power of God as the habit of Faith it ſelfe is; even as the fruits which (according to the opinion mentioned
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112049:148"/>were created with and upon their trees, did not grow out of theſe trees, nor were produced in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall way by them, as all after fruits growing upon them were, but were as proper and immediate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the creative power of <hi>God,</hi> as the trees themſelves. So we ſee at laſt, that the concluſion laid downe, is no waies prejudic'd nor ſhaken by either of theſe objections. <label type="milestone">

               <p>The ſentence or curſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> was not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his death, but this death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a ground or conſideration unto <hi>God,</hi> whereupon to diſpence with his <hi>Law,</hi> and to let fall or ſuſpend the execution of the penalty or curſe therein threatned. This is evident, becauſe the threatning and curſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> was not at all bent or intended againſt the innocent or righteous, but againſt tranſgreſſors onely. Therefore <hi>God</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting death upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being innocent &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, did not follow the purport or intent of the <hi>Law.</hi> If he had inflicted death upon all the tranſgreſſors of the <hi>Law,</hi> this had bin a direct execution of the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe this was that which the <hi>Law</hi> threatned and intended. But <hi>God</hi> in ſpareing and forbearing the tranſgreſſors, (who according to the tenor of the <hi>Law,</hi> ſhould have bin puniſhed) manifeſtly diſpenceth with the <hi>Law,</hi> and doth not execute it. As when <hi>Zaleucus</hi> (the <hi>Locrian Lawgiver</hi>) cauſed one of his owne eyes to be put out, that one of his Sons eyes might be ſpared, who according both to the Letter and intent of the <hi>Law,</hi> ſhould have loſt both, he did not preciſely execute the Law, but gave a ſufficient account or conſideration, why it ſhould for that time be diſpenced with, and not put into executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In this ſenſe indeed <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſaid to have undergone or ſuffered the penalty or curſe of the <hi>Law:</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, it was the curſe or penalty of the <hi>Law,</hi> as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112049:149"/>now hanging over the head of the world, and ready to be executed upon all men for ſinne, that occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his ſuffering of thoſe things which he endured.

Againe 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>; (and ſomewhat more properly) <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſaid to have ſuffered the curſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe the things which he ſuffered, were of the ſame nature and kind (at leaſt in part) with thoſe things, which <hi>God</hi> intended by the curſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> againſt tranſgreſſors, namely <hi>death.</hi> But if by the curſe of the <hi>Law</hi> we underſtand either that intire ſyſteme and hiſtoricall body (as it were) of penalties and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, which the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelfe intends in the terme, or elſe include and take in the intent of the <hi>Law</hi> as touching the quality of the perſons, upon whom it was to be executed; in neither of theſe ſenſes did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer the curſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> neither ever hath it, nor ever ſhall be ſuffered, by any tranſgreſſor of the <hi>Law</hi> that ſhall beleeve in him. So that <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the death and ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not that the <hi>Law</hi> properly, either in the letter or intention of it, might be executed, but on the contrary, that it might not be executed, I meane upon thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe obnoxious unto it ſhould beleeve.</p>
               <p>Neither did <hi>God</hi> require the death and ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a valuable conſideration whereon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with his <hi>Law</hi> towards thoſe that beleeve, <label type="milestone">

For it is evident that <hi>Chriſt</hi> both did and ſuffered many things, not ſimply as he was man, but as he was Mediator: eſpecially his voluntary ſubmiſſion of himſelfe unto death for the ranſome and attonement of the world, was the fulfilling of the great commandement in the <hi>peculiar Law</hi> of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator-ſhip, being no waies bound by any precept in the <hi>Morall Law</hi> thereunto. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had been bound as man, or by the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> to die for the ſinnes of men, his death had bin ineffectuall for others.

               <p>If it be objected and ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>5</label> 
                  <hi>that other men are bound to lay downe their lives for the truth when they are call'd thereunto, and ſo for one another.</hi> 1 John 3.16. and this muſt needs be by the Morall Law: therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtood bound by the ſame Law to doe the like.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, that men conſidered ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as men, and not as ſinners, or as men that have ſinned, were not bound by any Law whatſoever to lay downe their lives at all, nor upon any occaſion whatſoever: becauſe <hi>God</hi> by promiſe had ſetled the inheritance and poſſeſſion of life upon innocencie and integrity, for ever. Therefore as the Apoſtle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in another caſe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 21. <hi>Is the Law then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the promiſes of God? God forbid.</hi> So is it to be conceived in this caſe, that the promiſe of <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Dee this and thou ſhalt live,</hi> there was no Law that ſhould contradict it, that is, that ſhould enjoyne a man being innocent, and doing all things required in the Law, to die or part with his life, upon any termes whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſecondly, that obligation or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which now lieth upon men to part with their lives, either for witneſſing the truth, or upon any other occaſion, was not originally any branch of the Morall Law; but partly by reaſon of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening of ſinne, but eſpecially by reaſon of the great benefit of the redemption of the world from ſinne by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> it is now a ſuperadded duty (amongſt many others) ſomewaies reducible to the Morall Law, but not properly or directly conteyned in it. And thus the Scripture it ſelfe plainely determineth. For ſpeaking of this duty, of laying downe a mans life, in caſe the ſpirituall (yea or perhaps the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:112049:156"/>rall neceſſity of ſome men doe require it (and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there is the ſame reaſon of all other caſes in this kind) it grounds the equity and obligement of it, upon the grace and benefit of Redemption by the death of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt. Hereby have we perceived love, that he layd downe his life for us:</hi> THEREFORE <hi>wee ought alſo to lay downe our lives for our Brethren.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.16.</p>
               <p>So that (in the third place) <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally free from ſinne in and from the firſt inſtant of his conception to his death, and having none (nor any need of any) to die for his redemption, could have no tie or obligation upon him from the Morall Law, to lay downe his life upon any occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, in aſmuch as this Law in the firſt inſtitution and impoſure of it, requireth death of no man upon no occaſion but for ſinne (neither did it then require this by any way or duty, but of threatning) neither doth it now require it of any man, but upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of ſinne, and that great deliverance from ſinne, brought into the world by another, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) I anſwere yet further; that no man hath ever any calling from <hi>God</hi> by vertue of the Morall Law, as now it ſtands with all the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and improvements of it, to lay downe his life, either for witneſſing the truth, or for the benefit of the Brethren, or for any other poſſible end or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when that end (whatſoever it be) for which this laying downe a mans life ſeemes to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, may be aſwell, that is, as Lawfully, and as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provided for in another way. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither doth the Morall Law, nor <hi>God</hi> himſelfe by vertue of any commandement in this Law, require of men at any time, to die like fooles: and what is it but to die like a foole, when a man ſhall give his life for that, which might aſwell, and as effectually bee
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112049:156"/>procured by him in another way? If therefore it be conceived, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might be called <hi>God</hi> by vertue of the Morall Law, to lay downe his life for witneſſing or ſealing the truth, I anſwere, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> could have as ſufficiently provided for the honour and advancement of Truth another way, as by his death, <hi>viz.</hi> by the inward illumination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the judgementsand conſciences of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by his ſpirit. Therefore he had no call by the Morall Law, to die for this end. If it be yet objected: but the ſalvation of men his Brethren, could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by him in any other way, but by his death only: Therefore in this regard and for this end, he might be bound by the Morall Law, to die: To this I anſwere (as before in part) that the Morall Law conſidered as ſimply morall, <hi>i.</hi> as requiring only thoſe duties of a man, which were required of him in his eſtate of innocencie, threateneth all ſinners (without exception) with death, without giving the leaſt intimation or hope of any to die for them; ſo farre is it from impoſing it by way of duty upon any man whatſoever, to die for them. Therefore whatſoever may now be conceived to be impoſed upon any man by way of duty in this kind, doth not ariſe from the originall and native morality of the Law, but from that alteration and change which the grace of redemption by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> hath made in the eſtate and condition of men, by reaſon whereof many generall principles and impreſſions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive or directive part of the Law, are improved, and extended to many d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, which were not at firſt comprehended or intended in them. From all which duties it is evident, that the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> conſidered ſimply as a man, or as an innocent and ſinleſſe man, or as having his condition no waies altered or made better by any Redemption by any another, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Thus at laſt we have (I conceive) ſufficiently clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

In this ſenſe <hi>Shimei</hi> maketh requeſt to <hi>David,</hi> that he would not <hi>impute</hi> folly to him, that is, that he would not puniſh him for that fooliſh act of his reviling him. So the ſinnes of unbelievers may be ſayd to be <hi>imputed</hi> to them, when either they are puniſhed by <hi>God</hi> in this world, or elſe caſt into Hell for them. In this ſenſe alſo, the ſinnes of the elect themſelves before they beleeve, may be ſaid to be <hi>imputed</hi> to them, becauſe they are looked upon by <hi>God,</hi> as perſons yet liable to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for their ſinnes, and that ſhould in time actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be condemned, except by the precious benefit and advantage of <hi>Gods</hi> patience and long ſufferance towards them, they ſhould come truely to beleeve in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> before death.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:112049:160"/>upon the committing of one offence, he is charged with the guilt and inconveniences of another, the guilt and evill conſequences whereof are more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and manifeſt. Thus he that provideth not for his owne, eſpecially for his houſhold, hath the ſinne of denying the <hi>Faith, i.</hi> the Goſpell, <hi>imputed</hi> unto him (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.) becauſe the evill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of both ſinnes are much the ſame, but yet are more readily acknowledged, as likely to ariſe from the latter.

Thus (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4.) the reward, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>juſtification</hi> and life, is ſaid to be reckoned, or <hi>imputed</hi> to him that worketh, (<hi>i.</hi> that ſhall deſerve it by a perfect obſervation of the <hi>Law</hi>) of debt, and not of grace. The meaning is, that if any man ſhould be rewarded by <hi>God</hi> with life and happineſſe, upon his perfect obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> ſuch a reward would be generally taken and looked upon by men, as no matter of grace or favor from <hi>God,</hi> but as a matter of right and due debt to ſuch a man.</p>

               <p>The firſt rule I lay downe concernes the number of cauſes in generall, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>1</label> and is this: There are foure (and but foure) generall heads, fountaines, or kind of cauſes, whereunto and under which, all, and all manner of cauſes, be they never ſo many or various, which any waies conduce or contribute towards the raiſing of any effect or new being, may be reduced and comprehended.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>2</label> betweene the two former, and the two latter cauſes (as they were named) towards their effects, and is this. The <hi>efficient</hi> and <hi>finall</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do never <hi>ingredi compoſitum, i.</hi> are never any
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:112049:163"/>part, any thing of the ſubſtance, of the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced but are alwaies extrinſecall thereunto, and have their beings diſtinct from it. As on the other hand, the <hi>materiall</hi> and <hi>formall</hi> cauſes, are alwaies intrinſecall to the effect, and together make up (as it were) the intire ſubſtance and eſſence of it. As for example: The Carpenter who is the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of the Houſe that is built, and ſo his Axe, Saw, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are no parts of the houſe: neither is the conveniencie or accommodation of the dweller or owner, which is the finall cauſe of the Houſe, any part of it; which appeares thus, becauſe the houſe may ſtand, and be the ſame houſe that it is, though the Carpenter that made it be dead, and though it had neither dweller nor owner belonging to it. But the tymber, Brick, ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſe of it, and the order, or method wherein they are contrived and wrought together in the building by the workman: which is the formall cauſe, are the eſſentiall and conſtituting parts of the houſe: ſo that if either of theſe ſhould be altered or taken away, the houſe it ſelfe muſt be altered, and taken away with them.</p>
               <p>My third Rule toucheth the abſolute incapacitie in every one of theſe cauſes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>3</label> of any more relations then one, in reſpect of one and the ſame effect, and proceeds after this manner: No one thing or cauſe whatſoever, can put on more habitudes or relations of cauſalitie then one, in reſpect of one and the ſame effect. As for example, that which is the efficient cauſe of a thing, can never be the <hi>formall,</hi> nor the <hi>materiall,</hi> nor <hi>finall</hi> cauſe of it. So againe, that which is the <hi>materiall</hi> cauſe of a thing, cannot be the <hi>formall</hi> cauſe of that whereof it is the <hi>materiall,</hi> nor yet the <hi>efficient</hi> or <hi>finall:</hi> and there is the ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them all. Neither the Carpenter, nor his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:112049:164"/>skill, nor his Ax, nor his Hammer (which are all efficients) can be the matter of the houſe he builds with them: neither can the tymber or ſtones, which are the <hi>materiall</hi> cauſe of it, be the efficient cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true, in ſome caſes, and in an unproper and metaphoricall ſenſe, the ſame perſon that in one conſideration is the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of a thing, may in another conſideration be the <hi>finall</hi> cauſe of it. As when a Carpenter builds an houſe for himſelfe to dwell in, in a ſenſe he may be called both the <hi>efficient</hi> and <hi>finall</hi> cauſe of this <hi>houſe.</hi> But this is an unproper expreſſion, and according to Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and expreſſe importance of the words, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to truth. For if we ſpeake properly, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter cannot in this caſe be ſaid to be the <hi>finall</hi> cauſe of his houſe, becauſe the nature and propriety of the <hi>finall cauſe</hi> is, to receive it's being, by and from that, whereof it is the cauſe, and not to have a ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and being before it, as the Carpenter hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the building of his houſe. Therefore the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> cauſe of the houſe under inſtance, is the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters conveniencie of dwelling, which is a thing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother nature, and farre differing from his perſon. The like interpretation muſt rule to make exactneſſe of truth of that common ſaying in <hi>Divinity, that God is the efficient and finall cauſe or end of all things,</hi>

To proſecute all the diſtinctions or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of cauſes, that are found in Authors, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe might be thought upon, would be to caſt oyle upon the flames, and make the Reader double wearier of the length of his diſcourſe, then he is already.

               <p>The firſt generall head of cauſes, which we called the <hi>Efficient,</hi> admits of more diviſions and ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and conteynes more ſpecies of cauſes under it (which are yet all <hi>efficients</hi>) then any of the other, yea then all the other three together.

               <p>Firſt, of <hi>efficient</hi> cauſes, ſome are principall, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>4</label> others leſſe principall. The principall efficient cauſe, is that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:112049:165"/>which worketh independently and from it ſelfe (I ſpeake now in reſpect of created cauſes only: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe, all cauſes whatſoever have a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon <hi>God</hi> in their working towards the effect, having other efficients under it, which worke like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe towards the ſame effect, but depend upon it (the principall cauſe) in their working: and theſe are cauſes leſſe principall, or inſtrumentall. The Carpenter is the principall <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of the houſe, his Axe, Saw, and Hammer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <hi>efficients:</hi> becauſe though theſe conduce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomewhat towards the building of it, yet they are aſſum'd and ordered in their working by the Carpenter, and would do nothing if they were not acted and moved by him, whereas himſelfe worketh independantly, being acted and guided in his worke by a principle within himſelfe. It is true, in a ſenſe the Carpenter may be ſaid to depend upon his inſtruments in working, <hi>viz.</hi> as being unable to worke or build without them: but in point of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie, that only is counted a dependance, when a thing is either aſſumed, ſupported, or directed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in it's efficiencie: none of which can be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed of the Carpenter in reſpect of his inſtruments wherewith he worketh.</p>
               <p>Againe, of cauſes <hi>efficient,</hi> whether created or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, principall or leſſe principall, ſome are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, ſome artificiall, and ſome morall. By the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient naturall, I meane that cauſe which hath it's effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, or contributes towards the effect, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing or putting forth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of ſome power that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and eſſentiall to it. Thus the Sun is the naturall efficient cauſe of the light in the ayre, and of all other ſublunarie effects which it produceth, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them all only by the exerciſe and putting forth of ſuch principles, as of light, motion, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:112049:165"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as are naturall to it. In this ſenſe, that kinde of efficient which otherwiſe is called volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, <hi>i.</hi> that workes freely and with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its owne working, and is contradiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that which is purely and ſimply naturall, may ſometimes, and in reſpect of ſome effects, be termed naturall alſo, as <hi>viz.</hi> when it acteth towards any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by any faculty, principle, or power that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to it. In this ſenſe <hi>David</hi> may be called the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall efficient cauſe of the motion of the ſtone, wherewith <hi>Goliah</hi> was ſlaine: Yea the increated efficient cauſe himſelfe (<hi>God</hi> I meane, who in other reſpects, is termed the ſupernaturall efficient) may in this ſenſe be called the naturall efficient or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing cauſe of the world, (and ſo of all other effects whatſoever produced by him) <hi>viz.</hi> as he effecteth them either by that power, or by that authority which are naturall or eſſentiall to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the efficient cauſe artificiall, is that which produceth its effect by the exerciſe of ſome acquired or ſuperadded principle or habit of art. But of this kinde of cauſe we ſhall have no uſe in the buſineſſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> therefore we paſſe by it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) the morall efficient cauſe, is that which contributes towards an effect, by inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or moving the will or deſire of the naturall effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe (capable of ſuch motion) towards the doing or effecting of any thing. Thus firſt the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for which a workman contracts to build an houſe or the like, and ſecondly, the hope he hath of receiving this wages upon the performance of this work, and thirdly the inward diſpoſition which is in the workman, to undertake ſuch a worke in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſuch wages (with the like) may all be called morall efficient cauſes of that worke or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:112049:166"/>effect, whatſoever it be, that is performed by him. So the love and kindneſſe which <hi>Ionathan</hi> in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſhewed to <hi>David,</hi> were the morall e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>cient cauſes of that favour which <hi>David</hi> ſhewed to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth</hi> his Sonne. With this kinde of cauſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity, the greatneſſe of the ſinne of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> together with the ſeverity which is in the nature of <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> againſt ſuch ſinnes and ſinners, was the cauſe of that horrible deſtruction that came in fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone upon it, and the ſinne of <hi>Achan</hi> the cauſe both of his owne ruine, and of his whole Family, with infinite more of like conſideration.</p>
               <p>For that likewiſe is to be knowne and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, for our better underſtanding of the buſineſſe of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> when we come to it, that this impulſive or morall efficient cauſe is of two ſorts or kinds: Firſt, that which moves the naturall efficient from within himſelfe, to doe ſuch or ſuch a thing, which Logicians call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Secondly, that which from without moves or inclines him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, which they call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. As for example, when a man upon the knowledg or ſight of another mans miſerie in any kind, is perſwaded to adminiſter comfort or reliefe to him, the miſerie of the man being knowne to him is the latter kinde of cauſe of that comfort or reliefe which he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and the inward tenderneſſe or compaſſionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his nature towards thoſe that are in miſerie, is the former. Of both theſe kinds of efficients, there may be many, in reſpect of one and the ſame effect, ſome more principall, <hi>i.</hi> more effectually moving, and ſome leſſe; as will cleerely appeare in the eaſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>5</label> of the efficient cauſes, ſome are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and mediate; others againe more neere and immediate. The remote cauſe of a thing, is that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:112049:166"/>which contributeth towards the effecting of it, but yet doth not reach the effect it ſelfe, but by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall and mediation of another. The next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe, is that which produceth the effect, without the interveening of any other cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene. Thus a mans eating and drinking, are the remote cauſes of his health and ſtrength, by meanes of a good digeſtion, diſtribution, and incorporation of what is ſo digeſted, into the ſeverall parts of the body coming betweene, which latter are the neerer and more immediate cauſes thereof. So the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and diligence of an Apprentice in learning his Trade, are remote cauſes of that eſtate or ſubſiſtence, which afterwards he raiſeth by working upon it: and conſequently of all that good which he doth in any kind, with his eſtate ſo gotten. So that abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence or temperance which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 25. in him that ſtriveth for maſteries, is the remote cauſe of all thoſe victories and prizes which he obteyneth and carrieth away, by running, wreſtling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And generally whatſoever prepares or qualifies the naturall efficient for the producing or accompliſhing of any effect, may properly be called a remote cauſe of the ſame. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the perſonall holineſſe, and the <hi>active</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Law, may be called the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſes of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> but cauſes remote, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, becauſe they qualifyed him for ſuch ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whereby this great effect of <hi>juſtification</hi> was procured, but had no immediate influence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into.</p>
               <p>Onely that is briefly to be remembred concerning this diviſion of cauſes efficient, that as there may be many remote cauſes of one and the ſame effect, ſo there may be many immediate and conjunct cauſes alſo, (though ſome great Artiſts conceite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:112049:167"/>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Keckerman <hi>Syſtem. Logic.</hi> l. 1. c. 15. p. 146.</note> but theſe muſt ſtill be of ſeverall kindes. The principall and inſtrumentall cauſes are alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, in reſpect of the effect joyntly produced by them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the firſt, or increated cauſe, <hi>God,</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>like immediate in every effect, with the created cauſe that is moſt immediate to it.</p>
               <p>There are many other Diviſions and kindes of this firſt head of cauſes, which we call efficient, as 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, there is the efficient ſolitarie, and the efficient in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort or aſſociation with other cauſes. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent which hath a proper, naturall, and direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie towards the effect, which they call <hi>efficiens perſe:</hi> and the efficient which falls in on the by, and concurr's towards the effect, but accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and beſides any natural inclination it hath towards the raiſing of the effect, which they call <hi>cauſa per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, there is a kinde of efficient which they call <hi>ſubordinata, i.</hi> of an inferior order, in reſpect of another cauſe that is of a ſuperior; and <hi>coordinata, i.</hi> ſuch a cauſe, as is of the ſame ranke and order with another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides divers others; which I inſiſt no further upon, becauſe I conceive the Doctrine of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> may be ſufficiently delivered and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood without the particular knowledg of them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond generall head of cauſes mentioned, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>6</label> was the finall cauſe, or the end, ſo called (as it ſeem's) becauſe both the action and intention of the principall efficient are terminated, ended, and ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the aſſecution or atteynment thereof. There are ſeverall diviſions and kinds of this cauſe alſo: but becauſe there is little, or no diſpute or queſtion touching the finall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> amongſt thoſe that are much diſſenting in judgement about other cauſes thereof, I ſhall paſſe over this cauſe with the more brevity.</p>
               <p>The finall cauſe or end of an effect or thing cauſed,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:112049:167"/>or of a thing to be effected or cauſed, is either that which is called <hi>Finis perſe,</hi> that is, ſuch an end as the effect is naturally and of it ſelfe apt to produce, and raiſe: or elſe that which is called <hi>Finis per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> that is, ſuch a thing and end, which followes upon, and may be in ſome ſort ſaid to be produced or occaſioned by the effect, but yet is a thing of that nature and importance, which doth not anſwere the nature and propriety of the effect by which it was occaſioned or produced. Thus the hardening of reprobate and wicked men, and ſo the increaſing of their condemnation <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are accidentall ends of preaching the Goſpell, or of the Goſpell preached, becauſe they are oft occaſioned and ſomewaies cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and produced thereby, but do not anſwere or ſuite with the nature and propriety of the Goſpell or preaching thereof, which are ſweet and gracious. As on the contrary, the ſoftening and melting of the hearts of men, and ſo the furtherance of them in the waies of ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ends <hi>perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> or proper ends of the preaching the Goſpell, becauſe they are not only produced by it, but likewiſe are things that ſympathize in nature and property therewith, and ſweetly anſwere the tenor and importance of ſuch an action.</p>
               <p>Againe ſecondly, of finall cauſes or ends <hi>per ſe,</hi> ſome are primarily ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: others againe are ſecondarily ſuch, and leſſe properly ſo called. The finall cauſe or end primarily and properly ſo called, is that which the principall efficient intends to accompliſh and to attaine, by meanes of ſuch or ſuch an effect produced by him. And this againe is double, or of two kindes. Firſt, that which is more principally ſo intended by him; Secondly that which is leſſe principally intended. The end leſſe principally intended, is that which is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:112049:168"/>intended with reference and ſubordination to ſome further end, as <hi>viz.</hi> to that which is more and moſt principally intended: as on the contrary, the end more principally intended, is that which hath infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ends ſubſervient to it, and deſtinated to the effecting of it. Thus the houſe it ſelfe which the work man builds for himſelfe to dwell in, is the leſſe principall end of his labour in building and his own conveniencie of dwelling or otherwiſe, is the more principall, becauſe the houſe was intended chiefly in relation unto this. So the ſorrow which <hi>Paul</hi> wrought in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by his Epiſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.) was the leſſe principall end of his writing, and their repentance the more principall, becauſe that was intended by him, as a meanes conducing unto this. And that end which is intended ſimply for it ſelfe, and without any ſubordination or reference to another end beyond it, is the ſupreme, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne, and moſt principall end of all, as the glory of <hi>God</hi> is to himſelfe in all his works, and ſhould be to the creatures alſo in all theirs.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, the finall cauſe or end leſſe properly ſocalled, is that, to which or to whom, or for whoſe good, the end properly ſo called, is intended. Thus the patient or ſick perſon, is the end of that recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or health, which the Phyſician ſeekes to procure: and the elect, the end of the great dispenſation of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and in this ſenſe <hi>God</hi> himſelfe is ſayd to be end both of this, and all other his dispenſations whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The third generall head or fountaine of cauſes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>7</label> was the Materiall. Now the matter, or materiall cauſe of a thing, is either that which is properly, or unproper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called. The matter or materiall cauſe properly ſo called, is that which in union with the forme, makes up a ſubſtantiall compounded body. So that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:112049:168"/>this kinde of matter (matter properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) is proper to, and only found in that kinde of nature or being, which we call a ſubſtance, as the Heavens, the 4 Elements and all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and made of them, and is it ſelfe alwaies a ſubſtance. The matter of a thing unproperly ſo called, is that which hath ſome kinde of analogie or proportion onely to that which is matter properly. In this ſenſe, that other nature or kinde of being, which we call accidentall, as actions, paſſions, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, figures, relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ſaid to have matter, as <hi>viz.</hi> either their ſubjects wherein they have their exiſtences and beings, or their objects, upon, and about which they act, worke, or are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed: or thirdly (and laſtly) the parts whereof ſome of them doe conſiſt, and are made up. In the firſt ſenſe, the wall may be called the matter of the whiteneſſe that is put upon it, and the fire, the matter of the heate that is in it, and a man the matter of the learning or knowledge that is in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the ſecond ſenſe, the wall is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that act of the Painter or Plaiſterer, whereby he made the wall white; and ſo the ſervant or ſlave of old, was the matter of that act of <hi>manumiſſion,</hi> whereby his Mr. ſet him at liberty, and made him free; and the elect of <hi>God</hi> both men and women are the matter of the act of <hi>God,</hi> whereby he ſaves them. In the third and laſt ſenſe, the ſeverall parts of whiteneſſe that are in the wall, as the whiteneſſe that is above, and the whiteneſſe that is beneath, that which is on the right hand, and that which is on the left, with that which is in the midſt, are the matter of that <hi>area</hi> or whole extent of whiteneſſe which is in the wall. In this ſenſe, the three lines whereof a triangle is made, is ſaid to be the matter of the triangle, and letters and ſyllables to be the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:112049:169"/>matter of a word, and words the matter of a ſentence <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there is no accident whatſoever, that hath any matter properly ſo called: nor any actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter properly or unproperly, or however called, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſubject, matter or object, on which it is acted, and wherein it is terminated and received. What hath been ſaid concerning this materiall cauſe, is dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be remembred, and carried along with us to the buſineſſe of <hi>Juſtification;</hi> becauſe it much concern's one veyne of the Queſtion or controverſie depending.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt head of cauſes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>8</label> was that which is called the Forme, or formall cauſe of a thing. This cauſe is divided or diſtinguiſhed into that which is properly, and that which is improperly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The forme properly ſo called, is that cauſe, which together with the matter properly ſo called, conſtitutes and makes up a ſubſtantiall compounded body. This kinde of forme is alwaies it ſelfe a ſubſtance, and not an accident: and ſtill the more noble or principall part, of that body which it informeth. The particular ſpecies of it are not knowne, but onely by the properties and operations which flow from them reſpectively. The forme, or formall cauſe of a thing unproperly ſo called, (which is that kinde of forme wherewith only we have to doe in the buſineſſe of <hi>Iuſtification</hi>) is allwaies a thing of that inferior nature or being, which we call accidentall or adjunctive, Becauſe it is ſtill ſuſteyned in ir's being, in ſome other nature which is ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, and hath no ſubſiſtence in, or by it ſelfe, yet hath not this forme the denomination of a forme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in regard of the ſubject, wherein it hath it's being, and to which it gives a kinde of being alſo, as learning gives a man his being learned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in regard of that action or motion whereby it is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:112049:169"/>into the ſubject, and is therefore called the forme of an action, motion, or alteration, not becauſe it gives any other kinde of being to any of theſe (for it rather receives it's being from them) but only a being knowne and diſtinguiſhed from all other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or motions whatſoever. For actions, or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as <hi>calefaction, frigefaction,</hi> and ſo <hi>Redemption, Iuſtification, ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi> are ſeverally knowne and diſtinguiſhed one from another (and ſo from every other action or motion whatſoever beſides,) by that proper forme, impreſſion, or alteration which they introduce and make in their ſubjects or objects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which they are exerciſed and acted reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: as the heat or warmth which is cauſed in my hand by the fire, maketh that action of the fire by which it is cauſed, not ſimply to be, but to be known to be that action which we call <hi>calefaction</hi> or warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and none other, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In this caſe the heate which is cauſed in my hand, may be called the forme of <hi>cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> not becauſe it <hi>gives a being unto it (which is the proper notion and conſideration of a forme) but rather becauſe it receives</hi> it's being from it, and ſo gives it a manifeſtation or diſtinction from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions, which is one property of a forme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, according to the knowne maxime in Logique, which teacheth us, that the forme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes or preſuppoſeth 3 things, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, the being of a thing. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, the diſtinction of it. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, the operation of it.

                  </note> And doubtleſſe the terme or notion of a <hi>forme,</hi> can in no other reſpect (or at leaſt, in none ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) be aſcribed unto actions or motions, as in this: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe thoſe qualities, impreſſions, alterations, relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they cauſe and produce in their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:112049:170"/>ſubjects, have this analogie or proportion with formes properly ſo called, that they give diſtinction unto them, as theſe do to thoſe things or natures which they informe; though in another reſpect they be oppoſite to them (as hath bin ſaid) formes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called ſtill giving a being to the things whereof they are formes, whereas theſe formes appropriated to actions, alwaies receive their beings from them.</p>
               <p>So then to aske or inquire concerning the forme of any action, as <hi>Iuſtification, Redemption,</hi> or the like, what it is, is but to aske, what is the name, nature, property, or condition, of that effect, impreſſion, or alteration, which is immediately and preciſely cauſed and produced by it, in that ſubject matter, whether perſon or thing, whereon it is acted. Thus to aske, what is the forme of that action which we call <hi>frigefaction</hi> or cold-making, is but to aske, what the name and nature of that impreſſion or alteration is, which is cauſed thereby in that ſubject, whereon it worketh. And that (happily) may be one maine reaſon of the difficulty which is apprehended, and of the intricateneſſe and confuſion that are found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many writers touching <hi>the forme of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe the formes of Actions are ſeldome made matter of Queſtion or inquirie, either in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie,</hi> or <hi>Divinity,</hi> or in any other Art or Science, as farre as my weake learning and memory have taken notice: neither do I remember (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) any Queſtion on foote at this day, touching ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matter, or eſpecially the forme of any action, but only this of <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> Nor have I met with any, which do ſo much as plainely, perſpicuouſly, and diſtinctly, declare and explicate, what they meane by this forme of <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> whereby it may (I conceive) eaſily come to paſſe, that Authors may be at a loſſe one of another, and ſcarce one of

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>10</label> that he is the principall efficient cauſe, and not inſtrumentall, is evident alſo: becauſe he is not aſſum'd acted, or made uſe of by any other, in or about the <hi>juſtification</hi> of a ſinner; but himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth the whole frame and cariage of all things, yea and manageth and maketh uſe of all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally concurring or belonging thereunto. <hi>It is God that juſtifieth the Gentiles by or through Faith.</hi> Gal. 3.8. ſo Rom. 3.30, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>Thirdly that he is the Naturall efficient cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> (according to the notion and deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this cauſe given <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.) is evident becauſe in

               <p>Fourthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>11</label> the Morall or internall impulſive cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> as it is an act of <hi>God,</hi> is that infinite love, goodneſſe, mercy, ſweetneſſe, and graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in <hi>God</hi> himſelfe towards his poore creature, Man, looked upon as miſerable, and lying under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for ſinne. This was the moving and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of the guift of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his death and ſufferings, from him, and conſequently of that <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> which is procured and purchaſed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his ſufferings. <hi>So God loved the world, that hee gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever beleeveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> [<hi>viz</hi> by <hi>Iuſtification</hi> through him] <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the externall Morall or impulſive efficient cauſe of this act of <hi>God,</hi> is the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in, or through his death and ſufferings: or (which is the ſame) the death and ſufferings of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, God</hi> looking upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> as ſuch, and ſo great a ſufferer for the ſinnes of men, is thereby ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and provoked, to deliver thoſe that beleeve in him from their ſinnes and that condemnation which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:112049:172"/>is due unto them, <hi>i.</hi> to <hi>juſtifie</hi> them. The Scripture is cleere in laying downe this cauſe. <hi>Even as God, for Chriſts ſake, freely forgave you viz.</hi> your ſinnes, <hi>i. juſtified</hi> you. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.32. Thoſe words <hi>for Chriſts ſake,</hi> are a plaine and perfect character, of that kinde of cauſe we now ſpeake of.

               <p>The chiefe contention and diſpute amongſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Divines in the buſineſſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 139.</note> concerning the matter or materiall cauſe of <hi>Juſtification;</hi> the <hi>Socinian Diſeoverer,</hi> with ſome others, conceive they caſt a ſpirit of honour upon the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by ſetling this relation of cauſalitie in reſpect of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> upon them: but doubtleſſe much upon the like terms of miſtake, with thoſe mentioned by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.2. <hi>who ſhould thinke that they did God ſervice, when they killed his beſt ſervants.</hi> For</p>
               <p>Firſt, by making theſe the matter,
<note place="margin">See Part 1. c. 17. Sect. 1.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> or materiall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> they deveſt and ſpoyle them of the honour of that cauſalitie, which is proper and peculiar to them, and 7 times more honourable, then that which is this way attributed to them, <hi>viz.</hi> of that cauſalitie, which we call, <hi>meritorious.</hi> This
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:112049:175"/>is evident by the tenour of the third Rule formerly laid downe in the ſecond ſection of this Chapter, whereby it appeares, that no one cauſe whatſoever can put on more habitudes or relations of cauſality then one, in reſpect of one and the ſame effect. So that if the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the meritorious and impulſive cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> (which is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on all hands without exception; even by the men againſt whom we reaſon) it can at no hand be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the materiall cauſe alſo. Becauſe the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impulſive cauſe, is a kinde of efficient, as both hath bin lately proved, and beſides, is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo notioned and acknowledged by all: neither can it be reduced to any of the other 4 heads of cauſes, with any tolerable congruitie or colour of reaſon. It was never heard of to this day, that any efficient cauſe was the matter of the effect produced by it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> or <hi>Paſſive,</hi> or both, cannot be the matter of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> becauſe the matter of a thing is alwaies <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> incompletum,</hi> an incompleate and imperfect en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie or being, untill the introduction and union of the forme with it, which ſtill gives perfection of being and exiſtence to it. But the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> take it in what otion, or under what conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration you pleaſe, hath an intire, perfect, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate being; neither can it fall under imagination, what forme it ſhould be capable of, that by union with it ſhould adde beauty and perfection to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) if the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the matter of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> it muſt be either matter properly, or unproperly ſo called. Matter properly ſo called, which they call <hi>materia ex quâ,</hi> it cannot be, becauſe this kinde of matter, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> is proper to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall natures or beings onely. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, is it ſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:112049:175"/>a ſubſtance. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, is alwaies a part of that nature or thing whereof it is the matter. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, (and laſtly) is ſtill the inferior, weaker, and viler part thereof. Whereas <hi>Iuſtification</hi> (in the firſt place) being an act, hath only an accidentall, not a ſubſtantiall being: and conſequently is not capable of matter properly ſo called, as no act or action whatſoever beſides is. Secondly, the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be in <hi>praedicamento ſubſtantiae,</hi> to be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall nature, but an accidentall forme or quality: and therefore cannot be matter (properly ſo called) of any thing. Thirdly, the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be a part of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> becauſe <hi>Iuſtification</hi> (as hath bin ſaid) is an action, and the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> a forme or qualitie: and moſt certaine it is that one predicamentall nature or being, cannot be a part of another. Therefore the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be this matter of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> we now ſpeake of Fourthly (and laſtly) it is furtheſt of all from all colour or appearance of truth, that the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in what compoſition or union ſoever it ſhall be found, ſhould be the weaker and leſſe worthy part thereof, being of that infinit perfection and worth, which we all acknowledg, and aſcribe unto it: Therefore certainly it is no matter of <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>15</label> that neither is it any matter hereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſo called, may be thus demonſtrated. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unproperly ſo called, is either that which Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians call, <hi>materia in qua,</hi> or <hi>materia circa quam.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the former notion, imports only the ſubject of a thing, that is, a ſubſtantiall nature, as ſupporting ſome accidentall forme or being in it. In this ſenſe fire is ſayd to be the matter of the heate that is in it, and a man to be the matter of the learning or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he hath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is moſt unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:112049:176"/>and leaſt uſed ſenſe or ſignification, of the word MATTER, of all other. In the latter notion, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a thing, is the object, or that thing, upon which any thing acteth, or about which it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or exerciſed. In this ſenſe, wood or tymber may be ſaid to be the matter of the Carpenters art or imployment, and his Scholars the matter of the Maſters inſtruction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This kinde of <hi>matter</hi> is moſt commonly and properly attributed to acts that are tranſient, and with motion and alteration: though it may be aſcribed to that other kinde of act alſo, which is without alteration, and is called <hi>imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> in which ſenſe, bookes or the knowledge of things conteyned in them, may be ſaid to be the <hi>matter</hi> of the Schollers induſtrie or ſtudie, and the perſons predeſtinated to be the matter of that <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent</hi> act of <hi>God,</hi> which we call <hi>Predeſtination, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cannot in either of theſe notions or ſignifications of the word <hi>matter,</hi> be the matter of <hi>juſtification,</hi> it is evident. Firſt, not in the former, becauſe <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> is not the ſubject wherein this <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> inhereth, or whereby it is ſupported in being: the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath no dependance at all, in reſpect of the being of it, upon <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> Not in the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that act of <hi>God</hi> whereby he <hi>juſtifieth</hi> a ſinner, is not acted or exerciſed, upon or about the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor terminated in this, neither is there any change or alteration made in the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by that act of <hi>God,</hi> whereby he <hi>juſtifieth</hi> a ſinner; which yet muſt be, if it were that matter we now ſpeake of, that is, the object of <hi>Juſtification.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Iuſtification</hi> being a tranſient act in <hi>God,</hi> it muſt of neceſſitie make ſome change or alteration in that upon which it falleth or is acted, whatſoever
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:112049:176"/>it be: the truth is, that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being (as hath bin proved) the efficient impulſive cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> rather acteth and worketh upon <hi>God,</hi> then he upon it, when he <hi>iuſtifieth</hi> any man. Therefore doubtleſſe the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> can in no ſenſe, agreeable to truth and ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſpeech, be called the matter of <hi>Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore (in the laſt place) concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of, or materiall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>16</label> it can be none other, but either the ſubject, or the object of <hi>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath any action whatſoever any materiall cauſe at all, in this ſenſe. It remaineth therefore, that the matter of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> muſt be of that kinde of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is leſſe properly ſo called, whereof there are but theſe two ſpecies, or ſorts, (as hath bin ſaid) the matter <hi>in qua,</hi> and the matter <hi>circa quam, i.</hi> the the ſubject, and the object. If we take the ſubject of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> or him on whom the act it ſelfe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> in reſpect of the production and being of it dependeth, and will call that the matter of it, then <hi>God</hi> himſelfe muſt be the matter we inquire after: becauſe the act of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> in reſpect of the raiſing and bringing forth of it, dependeth only upon him. But this (I confeſſe) is a very uncouth and proper expreſſion, to call <hi>God</hi> the matter of <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> neither hath the tongue or pen of any man (I conceive) ever taken any pleaſure in it. Or if by the ſubject of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> we underſtand the <hi>ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum recipie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s,</hi> that is, the ſubject receiving, and wherein the act of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> is terminated (which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:112049:177"/>is as proper a ſignification of the word, as the other the old tried rule being, that <hi>actio eſt in patiente tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in ſubjecto</hi>) then the ſubject and the object will prove but one and the ſame, <hi>viz</hi> the perſon that is to be <hi>iuſtified,</hi> that is, the beleeving ſinner. Thus it is in all other actions likewiſe; the ſubject receiving the action or impreſſion of the Agent, and the object upon which the Agent acteth or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, are ſtill the ſame. And for any other matter of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> beſides that which hath bin now aſſign'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſinner who beleeveth, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there is none to be found: who though he be, both the object and ſubject (in the ſenſe given) of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> yet may he more properly be called the matter of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> as he is the object, then as the ſubject thereof, becauſe the notion of matter, better agreeth (of the two) to that which is called <hi>circà quam,</hi> or the object, then to the other, which is the ſubject.

This conſequence is pregnant and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:112049:179"/>conquering: becauſe this reciprocall <hi>imputation,</hi> is an act of <hi>God</hi> the Father (and ſo ſuppoſed by the Author himſelfe, and if rightly underſtood, not with any variation from the truth) whereas the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion mentioned, floweth from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (as hath bin already obſerved, and is here likewiſe expreſſely affirmed.)

               <p>Firſt: that which is an efficient cauſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot be the formall cauſe alſo. This is cleere by the tenor of that generall rule, laid downe Sect. <label type="milestone">

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:112049:182"/>hath bin already proved; and beſides, is (upon the matter) ſo acknowledged by the Authors themſelves of this opinion, who generally grant it to be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious or impulſive cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they who maintaine the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt imputed</hi> to be the formall cauſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt of neceſſitie hold, the beleeving ſinner, or the perſon to be <hi>juſtified,</hi> to be the materiall cauſe thereof, upon which ſuppoſition, I thus reaſon: No one and the ſame individuall forme, or formall cauſe, can poſſibly informe two ſeverall ſubjects, really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed the one from the other. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the beleeving ſinner, are two ſeverall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, really diſtinguiſhed the one from the other. Therefore the ſame individuall forme of <hi>righteouſnes</hi> cannot informe them both. Neither can it be here ſaid: that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the beleever are in this caſe conſidered as one and the ſame body or ſubject, and ſo one and the ſame forme of <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them both. For to this I anſwere 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, that that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the beleever be one and the ſame myſticall body, yet are they not one and the ſame naturall body, and therefore are not capable of one and the ſame naturall forme. As though man and wife be one fleſh (as the Scripture ſpeakes) and ſo one body, <hi>viz.</hi> in a civill ſenſe or conſideration; it doth not therefore follow, that this one body is capable in both the parts or members of it, of one and the ſame individuall naturall qualitie or forme: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though they be one civilly, yet they are two diſtinct perſons or ſubjects naturally. The wife is not not wiſe by the wiſdome, or ſtrong by the ſtrength of her Husband, ſhe may be both ſimple and weake, notwithſtanding the contrarie perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in her Husband. Yea in the naturall body it ſelfe, though all the members, be but one body (as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:112049:182"/>the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) yet the properties or qualities that are found in one member: as for inſtance, the organicall facultie of ſeeing in the eye, are not found in others, as in the hand, foote, or the like.</p>
               <p>And 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>24</label> if one and the ſame forme of <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> did informe both <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the beleever, becauſe they are one body, then one and the ſame ſinfullneſſe or corruption of nature might informe them alſo, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame ground: &amp; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be ſinful &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt with the ſame ſinfulneſſe &amp; corruption of nature w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are found in the beleever. Therefore the objection laid in, is of no value. Thirdly, if the <hi>righteouſneſse of Chriſt</hi> be the formal cauſe of Juſtification, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of a thing, may be the formal cauſe of it alſo. For the <hi>righteouſneſse of Christ</hi> (as hath bin often ſaid, &amp; once ſufficiently proved, &amp; generally is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) is the meritorious cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> But that that meritorious cauſe of a thing, can never be the formall cauſe alſo of the ſame, is fully evident from hence; becauſe the formall cauſe is alwaies intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call (<hi>what is more intrinſecall then the forme?</hi> ſaith Biſhop <hi>Downeham,</hi> as we heard before) and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the meritorious cauſe, alwaies extrinſecall. Now as it is impoſſible,
<note place="margin">See Sect. 2. of this Chap.</note> that he that is alwaies without the dores, ſhould at any time be within: ſo is it unpoſſible alſo, that that cauſe, whoſe eſſentiall charactar and propertie it is, to be alwaies extrinſecall, ſhould be intrinſecall at any time, or in any caſe whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> then is a Beleever to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteous with the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This Propoſition is evident, it being proper to every forme, to give a ſuteable denomination to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But that a Beleever is at no hand to be reputed righteous with the <hi>righteouſneſse of Chriſt,</hi> or with the ſame <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> wherewith Chriſt is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:112049:183"/>I thus demonſtrate and prove: He that may lawfully be reputed <hi>righteous,</hi> with the ſame <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſse</hi> wherewith Chriſt was <hi>righteous,</hi> may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be <hi>reputed</hi> never to have ſinned. The reaſon of this Propoſition is, becauſe that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> which either ſuppoſeth or admitteth ſinne in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with it, can be none of the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of Chriſt; the eſſentiall property whereof was to bee his <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> who never ſinned. But that it ſhould be lawfull to repute any <hi>juſtified</hi> perſon under Heaven never to have ſinned, is ſo notorions an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, that men need no further light (I conceive) to comprehend the darkneſſe of it. Therefore the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of Chriſt imputed, is not the formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi>

But that men are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally <hi>righteous</hi> with a meritorious <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> I thus demonſtrate. He that is formally <hi>righteous</hi> with a meritorious <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> may lawfully have the merit of ſuch <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> aſcribed unto him, and be himſelfe reputed the meritor of whatſoever is due upon juſt account to ſuch a righteouſneſſe. But the merit of the <hi>righteouſneſſe of</hi> Chriſt cannot lawfully be aſcribed unto any man, nor any <hi>juſtified</hi> perſon lawfully reputed the meritor of all that is due to that <hi>righteouſneſse.</hi> Therefore no man is formally <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> with the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of Chriſt. The aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this argument is unqueſtionable, and hath our Adverſaries themſelves friends to it: certainly no man is to be eſteemed or reputed one that hath meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or contributed any thing by way of merit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſalvation of the world, which is that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:112049:183"/>which is due to the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of Chriſt (at leaſt in the judgement of thoſe who oppoſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent controverſie) The reaſon of the former propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, is that old approved maxime in Logique. <hi>Dansformam, dat conſequentia formam. i.</hi> hee that gives the forme of a thing, gives all ſuch things with it, which do accompany and follow this forme. Now the Redemption and ſalvation of the world, is that which accompanieth and followeth, and which ſtill belongeth to the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of Chriſt. Therefore he that gives this forme to any man in the formalitie of it, gives the redemption and ſalvation of the world to him with it.</p>
               <p>If it be here objected and ſaid: its true, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſalvation of the world, follow the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of Chriſt, as it was performed by him, and perſonally inherent in him, not as it is <hi>imputed</hi> to men that beleeve.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, that in this objection, the Queſtion is begg'd, and that ſuppoſed, which is the maine hinge of the controverſie, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>imputation</hi> of the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> in the formalitie of it: a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that ſtands convicted (in the former part of this Treatiſe) of manifeſt untruth, by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of many witneſſes, both Divine and humane.</p>

                  </gap>, I anſwere yet further, that the meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> (ſuppoſing ſuch a propertie in it) muſt needs be eſſential to it and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from it. It is not an adventitious or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent propertie, but connaturall to it, ſeated and rooted in the very intrinſecall and conſtituting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of it. So that whatſoever be done with it, whatſoever becomes of it, to whomſoever it be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,</hi> this meritoriouſneſſe of it goeth along with it, and may be aſcribed to whomſoever the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> it ſelfe may be aſcribed. Yea, ſuppoſing this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:112049:184"/>propertie we ſpeake of, this meritoriouſneſſe, in the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> we muſt conſequently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be ſo eſſentiall and intrinſecall to it, that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> it ſelfe muſt needs be deſtroyed and turn'd into another <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of an inferior kind and importance, if that be ſeparated from it. As ſuppoſe a piece of gold to be of ſuch a value, as (for example) worth ten ſhillings (or the like,) to whomſoever this piece ſhall be given, there muſt of neceſſitie the value or worth alſo of ten ſhillings, bee given therewith unto him, the juſt value and worth of a thing being inſeparable from the thing it ſelfe, at leaſt the thing it ſelfe inſeparable from it.</p>
               <p n="3">3o, It would be knowne by what warrant either of Scripture or good reaſon, men ſhould make this a point of their Faith, that <hi>God,</hi> when he <hi>imputes</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſse of Chriſt</hi> unto men, ſhould ſtrip it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the meritoriouſneſſe of it; and ſo make it a <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> more worth-leſſe and vile, then any poſitive <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> whatſoever, conſiſting of workes, can be.

               <p>Sixtly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>26</label> if the <hi>righteouſneſse of Chriſt</hi> be the formall cauſe of <hi>juſtification,</hi> this muſt be verified either of the morall <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, or of his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:112049:184"/>Ceremoniall <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> alone or of his Mediatory <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> alone or of all, or ſome two of theſe together. But neither the morall <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, nor his ceremoniall <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſse</hi> alone, nor his mediatorie <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> alone, nor all, nor any two of theſe <hi>righteouſneſses</hi> together, can be the formall cauſe of <hi>Juſtification:</hi> therefore no <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> whatſoever is to be look'd upon in any ſuch relation of cauſalitie, in reſpect of <hi>juſtification.</hi> The propoſition in this ſyllogiſme (I conceive) carrieth the light of it's owne truth with it, The enumeration of the ſeverall ſpecies or kinds of <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> in Chriſt, is ſufficient. As for his originall, and habituall <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> I comprehend them both under his morall. Therefore if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſtick's, the aſſumption is to be blam'd for it. But that this alſo is blameleſſe, I thus demonſtrate, by the ſeverall parts of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that his Ceremoniall <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> alone ſhould be formall in <hi>juſtification,</hi> never as yet (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) entered into any mans head or heart, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Therefore (I preſume) we may ſpare the arguing of this me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, without any prejudice at al to our cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly that his mediatorie <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (which conſiſts in his paſſives) ſhould be the cauſe inquired after, is not (to my knowledge) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by any of that judgement we oppoſe in the depending controverſie. But howſoever, the truth of it thus appeares: becauſe the formall cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies gives a ſutable denomination to the ſubject. But no <hi>juſtified</hi> perſon can be called mediatorily <hi>righteous:</hi> therefore a mediatorie <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> is not the formall cauſe of <hi>juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the ſame argument, it is as manifeſt as heart can wiſh, that neither can both theſe <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes</hi> together, be that formall cauſe we ſpeake
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:112049:185"/>of: nor hath any man every et adventured either his credit or his conſcience upon this opinion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here alſo we will borrow confidence: and make reſtitution, when an adverſarie ſhall reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">See cap. 18. Sect. 3. of the firſt part.</note> that his morall <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> alone as diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated from his Ceremoniall, cannot be this formall cauſe, is evident: becauſe then the beleeving <hi>Iewes,</hi> who liv'd before <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming in the fleſh, and the beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſince, ſhould not be <hi>iuſtified</hi> with one and the ſame <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſse</hi> from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who liv'd before the diſſolution of the Moſaical oeconomie by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, were aſwell bound to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law Ceremoniall, as Morall: and therefore could not be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>imputation</hi> of a morall <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> only. Againe on the other hand, thoſe that have lived ſince the promulgation of the ſaid diſſolution made by Chriſt, were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free and not bound to the Law Ceremoniall, but were ſtrictly bound from it, and from the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rites and uſages therein commanded. Therefore for theſe to have the obſervation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall rites and Ceremonies <hi>imputed</hi> to them, is to have rather ſinne, then <hi>righteouſneſse, imputed</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, by this laſt conſideration alſo it appeareth, that the two laſt named <hi>righteouſneſſes</hi> of Chriſt, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall and Morall, cannot be ſo caſt or run into one, or ſo conſpire together, as to make the formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> we ſeeke after. The beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſince the promulgation of that <hi>Goſpell,</hi> muſt have no Ceremoniall threds woven into the piece of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> whereby they muſt ſtand <hi>iuſtified</hi> in the fight of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, that neither can his morall and mediatorie
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:112049:185"/>
                  <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſo comport or complie together, as to raiſe a third kinde of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> betweene them, that ſhould make the formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> ſo much queſtioned and contended about, may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently apprehended by what hath bin already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. For that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be compounded of theſe two, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be conceived to be a <hi>Mediatorie righteouſneſſe</hi> at the leaſt. For there muſt be nothing loſt of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, ſtrength, or perfection of either, in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But that no <hi>Mediatorie righteouſneſſe</hi> can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be formall in <hi>juſtification,</hi> was fully evinced and concluded in the fift argument.</p>
               <p>Seventhly (and laſtly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>27</label> for this opinion) it is the confeſſion or profeſſion, which you will, of ſome of the learnedeſt abettors themſelves of that way of <hi>imputation</hi> which hath bin oppoſed in this Treatiſe, that the generall current of Reformed <hi>Divines</hi> runns with an oppoſite ſtreame to this opinion, and with one mouth deny the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt imputed</hi> to be the formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.

               <p>Fiftly (and laſtly) there remaines yet another o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to be conſidered of, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>28</label> which looketh upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or forgiveneſſe of ſinnes,

               <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, That is eſpecially to be remembred, that wee doe not in this inquirie, ſeeke after the forme, or formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> ſimply, or of <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> largely taken, but of that particular and ſpeciall kinde of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> whereby a beleeving ſinner is juſtified by <hi>God</hi> through the redemption which is in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> For if we take <hi>Iuſtification</hi> in a large ſenſe, it is evident, that remiſſion of ſinnes cannot be the formall cauſe of it.

When <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to juſtifie the ſinner or ungodly, (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.) it is meant of his <hi>Conſtitutive Iuſtification,</hi> not of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative:</hi> For <hi>God</hi> never declareth or pronounceth a ſinner <hi>righteous,</hi> till hee hath made him <hi>righteous,</hi> which is the proper act of that which I call, <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Iuſtification.</hi> Againe, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>by thy words thou ſhalt be iuſtified.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:112049:188"/>the truth of the opinion mentioned, and undertaken for, which was, that Remiſſion of ſins is the forme, or formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, if Remiſſion of ſinnes be the firſt, immediate, and preciſe effect of that act of <hi>God</hi> whereby he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth a ſinner, in or upon the ſinner ſo juſtified, then is Remiſſion of ſinnes the proper formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> This conſequence is built cleere and ſtrong upon the third particular premiſed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aſſume: But remiſſion of ſinnes is the firſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and preciſe effect of that act of <hi>God,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he juſtifieth a ſinner, in or about the ſinner ſo <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. Ergo &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon of this latter propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, becauſe there is no other imaginable effect, that ſhould interveene, betweene ſuch an act, and the effect ſpecified. The Scriptures themſelves make an immediate connection betweene <hi>Gods</hi> act of <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and the ſinners exemption, or abſolution from his ſinnes, that is, from the guilt and puniſhment due unto his ſinnes, when they call <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> a <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> from ſinne. <hi>Be it knowne unto you, men and Brethren</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul. Act.</hi> 13.38.) <hi>that through this man is preached unto you remiſſion of ſinnes; and by him, all that beleeve, are juſtified from all things, from which yee could not be iuſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> Where we ſee that <hi>Iuſtification</hi> is immediatly and directly, from ſinne, <hi>i.</hi> from the guilt or condemnatorie power of ſinne. The like expreſſion you have <hi>Rom.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>He that is dead,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>is iuſtified from ſinne.</hi> So that this is the firſt priviledge or bleſſing, that comes upon a ſinner by meanes of his <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> or of that act of <hi>God</hi> whereby he juſtifieth him, the remiſſion of his ſinnes: and conſequently muſt needs be the forme of his <hi>Iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that which gives the denomination of juſtified, to thoſe that are juſtified, muſt needs be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:112049:189"/>the forme, or formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this propoſition, is apparant: it is ſtill proper to every forme, to give a ſutable denomination to the ſubject. Sutable I meane, not only to the forme it ſelfe, but to the action or motion alſo, whereby this forme was introduced into the ſubject. As for example: whiteneſſe in a wall that was made white out of ſome other colour, gives the denomination of whited, unto the wall: which doth not anſwere the forme it ſelfe onely, which is whiteneſſe, but that action alſo of the <hi>Plaiſterer</hi> or <hi>Painter,</hi> which wee call, whitening. Therefore it is evident, that the forme or formall cauſe of this act of whitening, is the whiteneſſe, or whitedneſſe of the wall. Thus farre then the ground is firme under us. Let us therefore goe forward, and aſſume: But remiſſion of ſinnes gives the denomination of <hi>iuſtified,</hi> to thoſe that are <hi>iuſtified.</hi> Therefore remiſſion of ſinnes is the forme, or formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> The aſſumption I thus further demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>If a ſinner be therefore and thereby <hi>iuſtified,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath his ſinnes remitted unto him, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes gives the denomination of <hi>iuſtified,</hi> unto him. This conſequence is pregnant, becauſe that alwaies gives the denomination, by the meanes or reaſon whereof, the ſubject is ſo, or ſo denominated. I aſſume: But a ſinner is therefore and thereby <hi>iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> becauſe, or in that he hath his ſinnes forgiven him. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The reaſon of the latter propoſition is, becauſe that <hi>Iuſtification</hi> we ſpeake of, being ſtill oppoſed to condemnation (as hath bin formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the Scriptures) muſt needs ſtand in a vindication or exemption from puniſhment, which being interpreted, is nothing elſe, but the having of a mans ſinnes forgiven. For there is no exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from puniſhment at the hand of an infinite Judge
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:112049:189"/>for him that is guilty, but by having his ſinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given: as on the other hand, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, is a full exemption in this kind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>31</label> that alteration or change in the condition of the perſon <hi>juſtified</hi> which is cauſed therein by that act whereby <hi>God juſtifieth</hi> him, muſt of neceſſitie be the forme, or formall cauſe of his <hi>juſtification.</hi> The third particular premiſed, is a ſufficient light wherby to ſee the truth of this propoſition, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aſſume: But remiſſion of ſinnes, or abſolution and acquitting from puniſhment (which are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively the ſame) is that alteration or change which is made in the condition of a perſon <hi>juſtified</hi> by that act of <hi>God</hi> whereby he <hi>juſtifieth</hi> him. <hi>Ergo</hi> this alteration or change is the formall cauſe of <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> The reaſon of the latter propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> being (as I ſuppoſe is confeſſed on alhands) a civil or politique act, as all actions of <hi>Iudicature</hi> are, muſt needs produce a civil or politique effect anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to it. Al acts &amp; actions beget only in their own ſimilitude &amp; likeneſſe. A natural action cannot produce a morall effect: nor a morall action, a naturall effect. Neither can a civill or politique action, produce ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a naturall or morall, but only a civill or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique effect. When a Judge acquits (and ſo when he condemn's) a man from a crime or accuſation brought in againſt him, this makes neither any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nor morall change in the perſon of him that is ſo acquitted, except it be occaſionally &amp; by accident, as when by ſuch a ſentence of abſolution a man is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of thoſe feares, which were prejudiciall to his health whilſt he lay under danger of the ſentence of the Law, or the like: but properly and directly ſuch an act produceth a civill or politique change in his condition. For whereas he was before in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Law, and obnoxious unto puniſhment, he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:112049:190"/>is now at liberty and free therefrom. So when a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſinner is <hi>juſtified</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> the effect of this act of <hi>God,</hi> is not any naturall or morall change made upon him, but a change in his eſtate and condition. Now there is no other change that can be imagined ſhould be made in the ſpirituall eſtate or condition of a man, by the act of <hi>Gods Iuſtification</hi> falling on him, but onely his acquitting from the guilt of ſinne, and puniſhment due unto the ſame. Before this act of <hi>God</hi> paſſed upon him, he was under the guilt of ſinne, and obnoxious to the wrath of <hi>God:</hi> but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this upon him, he is abſolutly free and exempt from danger that way.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>32</label> that which makes a <hi>juſtified</hi> perſon, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and compleatly juſt or righteous before <hi>God,</hi> is (queſtionleſſe) the formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> This propoſition is greater then exception, nor will (I conceive) be denied by our keeneſt adverſaries in the maine. I aſſume therefore: But remiſſion of ſinnes is that which makes a <hi>iuſtified</hi> perſon formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and compleatly righteous before <hi>God.</hi> Therefore this is the formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> The reaſon and ground of the aſſumption is this: becauſe he that ſtands as cleere, and as free from ſinne, or the guilt of ſin, in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> as he that having liv'd a 1000 yeeres, ſhould alwaies have obſerv'd the Law, and never tranſgreſſed in the leaſt point, is (doubtleſſe) formally &amp; compleatly righteous in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi> Now that remiſſion of ſins gives this privilege to him that hath received it, in as ful &amp; amplea manner, as the exemplified obſervation of the <hi>Law,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the longeſt continuance that is imaginable can do, hath bin more then once demonſtrated in this Treatiſe, eſpecially in the fift Concluſion layd down in the ſecond Chap. of this ſecond Part.

This is evident: becauſe by the formall cauſe of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> we meane nothing elſe (as hath bin often ſaid) but <hi>Iuſtification paſſive,</hi> or that guift which by <hi>God</hi> is given unto men (and by them received accordingly) in and by that act of his whereby he <hi>iuſtifieth</hi> them. So that if remiſſion of ſinnes be that which is given unto ſinners by <hi>God,</hi> for, or unto their <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> it muſt of neceſſitie be conceived to be the formall cauſe thereof. Therefore I aſſume: but remiſſion of ſinnes is given by <hi>God</hi> unto men for their <hi>Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and reacheth home unto it: Therefore it muſt needs be the formall cauſe thereof.

The reaſon
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:112049:193"/>whereof I conceive to be this: the opinion in this caſe being their owne, muſt needs have a ſtrong and perfect ſympathie with all the powers of nature yet unſanctified, and ſo muſt needs engage theſe: and then againe, being look'd upon as a truth of a divine parentage, and iſſuing from <hi>God,</hi> by means of this apprehenſion, it engageth all the powers of Grace, and of the new man alſo to contend for it. And thus, what by the nature and ſubſtance of it on the one hand, being erronious and ſinfull; and what by the appearance and ſhew of it on the other hand, being as if it were indeed ſpirituall and divine, it is apt to tranſport a man with an extaſie of zeale even above himſelfe for the maintenance of it, and to inſpire him with reſolutions of ſacrificeing credit, Name, eſtate, friends, himſelfe upon the honour and ſervice of it, in caſe it be oppoſed.</p>
               <p>Now amongſt many ſignes that might be given of an opinion of that very frame and conſtitution we ſpeak of, darkneſſe for ſubſtance, and light in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, this is one of frequent obſervation; when the maintainers of it are ambitious to heap up citations of Scripture proofes, without end, and to overwhelm their adverſaries with Divine teſtimonies. For as the ſaying is, <hi>Nuſquam eſt, qui ubique eſt,</hi> he that is every where, is no where: ſo it is much to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that ſuch an opinion is no where in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is pretended to be every where. When men ſharke about for Scriptures, and cannot find thoſe that willingly and freely offer themſelves in the ſervice of an opinion, but labour and toyle (as it were) in the fire, to redeem the defect of full and pregnant proofes, with multitudes and numbers of ſuch as they can find, it is a ground of much ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the opinion is not of <hi>God,</hi> but of men.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures are many, which are muſtered up
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:112049:194"/>by the Maſters of that way of <hi>Imputation</hi> which we oppoſe, for the ſervice of their opinion: but amongſt them all there is not one that comes roundly on, or that ſpeaketh plainly or directly to the buſineſſe in hand: which is a plaine ſigne that it is not indeed they that ſpeak at all, but the ſpirit of the men that ſpeaketh in them, whatſoever they ſeem to ſpeake in this kind. I make no queſtion but I ſhall be able to give a thorough and perfect accompt of what I now affirme, by a particular examination of the Scriptures themſelves alledged in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of them (I conceive) have bin occaſionally touch'd already, and in part cleered, in this diſcourſe. But becauſe a true and ſolid under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them, carryes the maine ſtroke in the Queſtion and controverſie depending, I thought good to aſſigne an intire Chapter for the interpretation and ſolution of them: ſo that the Reader may more readily know where to find, and whither to repaire for explication of them al together.

It is moſt probable, that by <hi>covering of ſinne,</hi> ſomwhat ſhould be meant, which is contrary to that which the Scripture expreſſeth by a diſcoverie of ſinne. Now it is evident from theſe (and many like places more) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.57. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.10.29. <hi>Job.</hi> 20.27. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that by diſcovering of ſinne, is meant the executing of judgements, or inflicting of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon ſinners anſwerable to their ſinnes; which may wel be called a diſcovering of ſin and wickednes, becauſe neither the ſinners themſelves, nor yet others, are ordinarily capable of any knowledge or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion to purpoſe of the demerit and vileneſſe of <hi>ſinne,</hi> but by meanes of the ſeverity of God expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſelfe in viſible judgements upon thoſe that have ſinned.

To this purpoſe when he ſhews any outward favour or countenance to men, as by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting them from dangers, or delivering them out of trouble, or the like, he is ſaid to <hi>juſtifie</hi> them: <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the righteous, to give him</hi> (or, by giving him) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his righteouſnes,</hi> 1 King. 8.32. compare herewith 2 Chron. 6.23.

               <p>Secondly, it is wholly repugnant both to the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall and Rhetoricall importance of the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and words, as likewiſe diſagreeing from the Scripture phraſe, and manner of ſpeaking in the like caſes, to put ſuch a ſenſe or interpretation upon them as this. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, Chriſt</hi> can in no tolerable conſtruction of ſpeech be ſaid to be <hi>imputed</hi> to us (the <hi>imputation</hi> of a perſon was never heard of) therefore cannot be ſaid to be <hi>imputed</hi> to us for our <hi>righteouſneſse.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) the plaine and direct meaning of the place, is this. <hi>This is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our righteouſneſse,</hi> that is, He ſhall be generally acknowledged and celebrated by his people the Jewes (for the Prophet ſpeak's particularly of theſe, as is evident in the context) as the Greate Author and procurer of that <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse</hi> or <hi>juſtification</hi> in the ſight of God (for <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse</hi> is very uſually put for <hi>juſtification,</hi> as was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. cap. 3.

Neither by <hi>the robe of righteouſneſſe,</hi> are we to underſtand, the whole and entire obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the morall Law (there being neither word, ſyllable, letter, or tittle any waies leading or inducing to ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation) but the effect of the <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, of the truth and faithfulneſſe, or elſe of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and graciouſneſſe of God (both which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expreſſed in the Scriptures, by the word <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> as was before obſerved. cap. 3. Sect. 2.) <hi>viz.</hi> their deliverance from their captivitie, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their peace and ſafety, and many other ſweet and comfortable priviledges thereupon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we carrie theſe metaphors of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and robe, in a ſpirituall way, and underſtand them of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the promiſe that is ſuppoſed to be conteyned in them (and a promiſe doubtleſſe there is, though conceived in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon propheticall ſtreyne of the time paſt, to ſhew the certainty of it to be equall to things that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done) and to be made unto the Church, will not be ſutable or proper thereunto. Becauſe the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is already, and at all times cloathed with the robe of the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in ſuch
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:112049:198"/>a ſenſe) that is, is in a juſtifyed condition by him. Yea, her <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is that which gives her, her very being, as ſhe is his Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for God to promiſe unto thoſe, that are already juſtified by Chriſt, <hi>a robe of righteouſneſſe</hi> by which they ſhould be juſtified, is as if he ſhould promiſe Heaven to his elect Angells, who are already fully poſſeſſed thereof and confirmed in their poſſeſſion, or promiſe reaſonable ſoules to men, who cannot be men without them. So that (doubtleſſe) it is no ſpirituall privilege (at leaſt not <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> of all other) that is here promiſed to the Church of God. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) if we underſtand the paſſage now under conſideration of an externall deliverance (as we heard <hi>Muſculus</hi> and other Interpreters doe) the metaphor will be found ſweet and lively, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>6</label> and very emphaticall, yea and conſonant to the ſpeech and language of the Scripture elſewhere. We know it was a cuſtome among the Jewes (and there are few Nations, I conceive, but have ſomewhat of it, more or leſſe) to attire, habit, and cloath themſelves ſutably to their preſent conditions. They had ſackcloath to weare in times of mourning, and they had garments too, proper for times of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I forbeare to cite Scriptures for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, becauſe they are obvious. Now then when God promiſeth to cloath his Church being yet in bondage and miſerie, with the garments of ſalvation, he implieth that for the preſent, they were cloathed like exiles and priſoners and captives, that is, that they were in theſe conditions, and ſo ſubject to all the inconveniences and miſeries incident to them. But he will change their garments, that is, alter their eſtates and conditions; of ſervants, he will make them free; of baniſhed, he will make them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:112049:198"/>poſſeſſors of their own land: of poore, he will make them rich, of vile and contemptible, he will make them honourable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The full and entire happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of which new condition, the Prophet by the figure ſynecdoche, expreſſeth by the change of their garments according to the uſuall manner of the Scripture, which often ſignifieth the eſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the garments proper to it. As <hi>Junius</hi> hath well obſerved in his annotations upon <hi>Eſay</hi> 22.17.

To paſſe by all other Scriptures, wherein the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Iunius</hi> mentioned, might be exemplified; the Booke of the <hi>Revelation</hi> repreſents unto us, both the dignitie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, and likewiſe of his Saints, after the ſame manner, by robes and garments, and that more then once or twice. <hi>And in the midſt of the</hi> 7 <hi>Candleſticks, one like unto the Sonne of man, cloathed with a garment down unto the feet.</hi> Revel. 1.13. This repreſents the great dignitie of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> In like manner the honour of his Saints and faithfull ones is thus expreſſed, cap. 3, 4, 5. <hi>And they ſhall walke with me in white: for they are worthy.

<note place="margin">Revel. 19.7, 8. cleered and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the way.</note> 19.7.8. it is evident that nothing is ſpoken or meant concerning <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſse,</hi> but only that great honour and reward is hereby ſignified, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> was now pleaſed to conferre upon his Church and Saints, who were <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified</hi> by him long before. The <hi>pure, fine, and ſhining linnen,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the righteouſneſse of the Saints,</hi> to ſhew that the greate glory, honour, and dignitie which <hi>Chriſt</hi> now conferreth upon his Church, is the gracious and bountifull reward of her Husband, by him given unto her, in conſideration and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> that is, her holineſſe, faithfulneſſe, zeale, conſtancie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Beaſt, and great Apoſtacie of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world. It is an uſuall manner of ſpeech in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to expreſſe the reward of a thing, by the Name of the thing it ſelfe, whereof it is a reward. Thus <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.7. the Elders of <hi>Midian</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> are ſaid to have departed, having <hi>Divinations</hi> (for ſo it is in the originall) in their hand, that is, the money or reward of <hi>Divinations.</hi> So 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.10.

So from <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. v. 2. compared with the 4. as alſo from diverſe other places, both of the Old and New Teſtament. Now it is no waies like, that the Apoſtle ſhould ſeek to prevent the leſſer and lighter offence in this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and wholly neglect them under the greater. 2. becauſe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>juſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> taught by the Apoſtle, did not carry any ſuch colour or appearance of oppoſition to the morall part of their Law, as it did to the Ceremoniall.

               <p>Thirdly, neither doth the Apoſtle here oppoſe unto, or compare the obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> as one act, unto, or with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as ſatisfaction to and with the provocation, or the remedie to and with the diſeaſe.

               <p>Fourthly, by that obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby it is here ſaid that many are (or, ſhall be) made <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> that is, <hi>juſtified,</hi> we cannot underſtand, that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which conſiſts only in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the morall Law, but that ſatisfactorie <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> or obedience which he performed to that peculiar Law of Mediation, which was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon him, and which chiefly conſiſted in his ſufferings.

Mr, Gatak, in Elench, Gomar, p. 49.</note> are men of this interpretation. Amongſt whom, <hi>Pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> gives two reaſons of this his Expoſition. The firſt is, the antitheſis or oppoſition which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes betweene the diſobedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the obedience of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> which (ſaith he) will not <hi>conſtare</hi> if by <hi>the obedience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we underſtand <hi>vniverſalem ejus conformitatem cum lege,</hi> that is, his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:112049:204"/>univerſall conformitie with the Law, the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Adam</hi> being but <hi>ſingularis</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and particular tranſgreſſion. But his latter and greater reaſon is, the effect which is here attributed to this obedience of <hi>Chriſt, viz.</hi> the <hi>juſtification,</hi> or righteous-making of many, which (ſaith he) the Apoſtle hitherto hath conſtantly vindicated or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the death and blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yea and the whole Scripture throughout teacheth our Faith to ſeeke its <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> in this obedience of his. So that all this while here is nothing at all appeares for the countenancing of that <hi>imputation</hi> of the active obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which takes ſo deeply with the thoughts of many.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Suppoſe, that by <hi>the obedience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we ſhould here, contrary to the generall current, aſwell of Interpreters as the Scriptures themſelves, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that <hi>active righteouſneſſe</hi> or <hi>obedience</hi> which he performed to the Morall Law, yet will it not follow from hence, that therfore men muſt be <hi>juſtified,</hi> or made <hi>righteous</hi> by it in ſuch a way of <hi>imputation</hi> as is contended for. For certaine it is, that that <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> or <hi>righteous</hi>-making, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in this 19. verſe, is the ſame with that which he had ſpoken of, v. 16, 17, 18. Now that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> (as he calls it, v. 17.) is deſcribed v. 16. to be <hi>the guift (i.</hi> the forgiveneſſe) <hi>of many offences, i.</hi> of all the <hi>offences</hi> whereof a man either doth, or ſhall ſtand guilty before <hi>God, unto juſtification:</hi> and evident it is, that that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> or <hi>juſtification,</hi> which ſtands in the guift (or forgiveneſſe) of offences or ſinnes, cannot ſtand in the <hi>imputation</hi> of an obſervation or fulfilling of the Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. (and laſtly) it is but a looſe and very unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kind of arguing, to reaſon from a thing ſimply done, to a determinate manner of doing it. If a man
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:112049:204"/>ſhould argue thus, <hi>Peter</hi> was ſlaine with death: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſlaine by a Beaſt, or therfore he was ſlaine with a Dagger, were there the leaſt ſhaddow or appearance of the certainty of the Coucluſion, in the premiſes? So when the Apoſtle ſimply and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmes, that by the <hi>obedience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> men are made <hi>righteous,</hi> to inferre and conclude a particular and determinate manner of <hi>rigteous</hi>-making from hence, as <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>imputation</hi> of this <hi>obedience,</hi> there being other waies or manners of <hi>righteous</hi>-making, (as hath bin proved) hath no power nor authority at all of an Argument in it.</p>

And that it cannot be here meant preciſely of the Morall Law, is evident: 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, becauſe that impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>iuſtifying</hi> men thorugh the weakneſſe of the fleſh, ſpoken of ver. 3. is not confin'd to this Law alone, but extends aſwell to the other two, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and Judiciall: except we ſhall ſay, that though the Morall Law was weake through the fleſh, and could not <hi>iuſtifie,</hi> yet the Ceremoniall and Judiciall had a ſufficiencie of ſtrength hereunto; which is manifeſtly untrue. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, becauſe the Jewes, to whom eſpecially he addreſſeth himſelfe in all his diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the Law, and <hi>Iuſtification</hi> thereby, built aſmuch or more upon the obſervation of the Ceremoniall Law for their <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> then of the Morall, (as was formerly obſerved Sect. 8. of this Chapter.) Now its certaine that the Apoſtle here takes the word <hi>Law,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, wherein the Jewes meant it, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and argued for <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by it: otherwiſe he ſhould not argue with them <hi>ad idem,</hi> nor reach their apprehenſions or meaning. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, becauſe the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:112049:207"/>Morall Law, ſuppoſe it had not bin made weake, nor diſadvantag'd by the fleſh, yet could it not by the moſt exact obſervation of it, have juſtified men, at leaſt not all men, and by name not the Jewes, who were bound to the obſervation of the other two, aſwell as of it, and had bin found ſinners, had they faild in any point of either of theſe, though they had bin abſolute in the other. Now it is evident, that by <hi>the righteouſneſſe</hi> (or <hi>Iuſtification</hi>) <hi>of the Law</hi> in this place, the Apoſtle meanes the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> (or <hi>Iuſtification</hi>) of ſuch a <hi>Law,</hi> which in it ſelfe was able to <hi>iuſtifie,</hi> had it met with a ſufficiencie of ſtrength in men anſwerable to it. Therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceiv'd to ſpeake here determinatly of the Morall Law, which had no ſuch abilitie in reſpect of the Jewes. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, and laſtly, becauſe the Jewes had bin never the neerer a <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> by the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of the Morall Law <hi>imputed</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto them (ſuppoſing ſuch an <hi>imputation</hi>) being (as hath bin ſaid) under the tranſgreſſion of other Lawes.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>19</label> neither is it any waies agreeable to truth, that the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt imputed</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers (ſuppoſe ſuch an <hi>imputation</hi> were ſimply granted) ſhould be called <hi>the end of the</hi> Morall <hi>Law</hi> For (doubtleſſe) no Law whatſoever conſidered ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as a Law, is any cauſe or meanes of juſtifying a perſon, in any other way, or by any other meanes, then by the obſervation of it ſelfe: and conſequently, <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be conceived to be the end of the Morall Law. For nothing can properly be ſaid to be the intent or end of a thing, but only that, which in reaſon and likelyhood may be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and obtained by it. Now there is an utter and evident impoſſibilitie, that <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be procured or attained by the Morall Law. Neither obedience nor diſobedience thereunto, hath any relation of cauſalitie to ſuch an effect, a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never the neerer <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either for the one, or for the other. It may be ſaid with farre a more favourable aſpect both upon reaſon and truth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the end of the Ceremoniall Law: and yet not of this neither, conſidered ſimply, as a Law, but as comprehending in it ſuch and ſuch uſages or rites, wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by his blood were typified and reſembled, and which were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and to loſe the binding power of a Law, which it had before, upon <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming. As for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or tranſgreſſion of this Law, neither the

               <p>Fourthly, ſome Interpreters conceive, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this ſenſe is ſaid to <hi>be the end of the Law for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to him that beleeveth,</hi> becauſe the Law by convincing men of ſinne, and exacting of them a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which it doth not enable them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and againe by threatning and condemning them for the want of it, it doth as good as lead them by the hand unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whom they are freely <hi>juſtified.</hi> This Expoſition calls <hi>Muſculus</hi> Maſter,

               <p>Firſt, from the cariage and tenor of the context it ſelfe. For doubtleſſe the Apoſtles meaning is,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:112049:212"/>that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould <hi>be the end of that Law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> by the obſervation whereof, as being their own righteouſneſſe, ver. 3 the Jewes, againſt whom he here reaſons, ſought to be <hi>juſtified.</hi> Now it hath bin often ſaid, and once (at leaſt) ſufficiently proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Jewes ſought <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and ſelfe <hi>Iuſtification</hi> afwell from the obſervation of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, as of the Morall Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly from the full conſent and entire ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of other Scriptures of like propenſion and phraſe. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. It is ſaid, that <hi>the Children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly looke to the end of that which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,</hi> that is, of the whole miniſterie or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as is evident from the cariage of the whole Chapter. Now what was <hi>the end</hi> of this diſpenſation, but <hi>CHRIST</hi> and <hi>Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by him? So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Wherefore the Law was our Schoolemaſter unto Chriſt, that we might be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Faith.</hi> By the Law in this place, cannot be meant the Morall Law; the whole ſeries of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text from ver. 13, to 25. riſeth up againſt ſuch an interpretation; neither is there any Expoſitor I know, that ſo underſtands it, but by the Law, which is here ſaid to be <hi>our Schoolemaſter unto Chriſt,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably meant, the whole frame or body of the adminiſtration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet with a more peculiar reference to the Ceremoniall part of it. See Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> judgement touching this Scripture, in his little Tract againſt <hi>Gomarus,</hi> p. 54.54. and againe in his <hi>Scripta adverſaria</hi> (as he call's them) p. 43. of the firſt part, and p. 96. of the ſecond: together with Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> upon the place.</p>
               <p>Thus at laſt we have (I ſuppoſe) abundantly vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the <hi>Non-imputation</hi> of the Active obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the ſenſe controverted, out of the hand of all thoſe reaſonings and pleadings, that are uſually
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:112049:213"/>(or that readily I thinke can be) build upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> wherein notwithſtanding the greateſt part of the ſtrength and confidence of our Adverſaries lyeth: And therefore I ſhall make bold to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate the Reader with more brevity ingiving anſwere to thoſe other Scriptures, which yet remain.</p>
               <p>The next of which, <label type="milestone">

But to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that here is a little or leſſe colour for the deemed <hi>imputation,</hi> then in any of the former Scriptures. For</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> is here no otherwiſe, nor after any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner affirmed to be, or to be <hi>made righteouſnes unto us,</hi> then he is to be made <hi>wiſdome</hi> or <hi>ſanctification</hi> unto us. Therefore there is no more ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> for our righteouſneſſe, then of his wiſdome for our wiſdome, or his ſanctification for our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And if it be a weake and unſavourie infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from this place, to conclude that we are wiſe with the ſame wiſdome, wherewith <hi>Chriſt</hi> was wiſe, being <hi>imputed</hi> unto us; it muſt needs be a bird of the ſame feather, to infer, that we are <hi>righteous</hi> with the ſame <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> wherewith <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> being <hi>imputed</hi> to us. Here is no more menti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on or intimation of the <hi>imputation</hi> of the one, then of the other. Suppoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> were <hi>made righteouſneſſe unto us,</hi> by the <hi>imputation</hi> of that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of his, which men ſo much contend for; yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more evident, then that this ſpeciall manner of his being made <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> muſt be made good otherwiſe, and from other Scriptures, and cannot at all be prooved from this place. As becauſe a rich
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:112049:213"/>man hath ſilver and gold and jewells in his poſſeſſion or keeping, it doth not follow, that therefore he hath ſilver in one Cheſt, and gold in another, or jewells in a third, becauſe he may poſſibly have them al in one &amp; the ſame. From generall expreſſions, particular modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of things can never be prooved. Therefore</p>
               <p>Secondly, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be made righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse unto us,</hi> the meaning only is, that he is made or ordained by <hi>God</hi> to be the Author or ſole meanes, by way of merit, of our <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> purchaſed and procured for us by his death and ſufferings. This Expoſition is ſtrengthened,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the word, <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> or <hi>Iuſtification</hi> which beleevers have in, or by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſtill attributed in the Scriptures to the death and ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (as hath bin formerly obſerved

               <p>The next Scripture that is much ſollicited by ſome, to ſpeake a good word in the cauſe of the

               <p>I ſhall only inſiſt upon one Scripture more, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>26</label> and that with ſomewhat the more brevity, becauſe the argument or proofe that is drawne from it, is more ridiculous and importune, then any of the former. One copie of this Scripture is found, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>For it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them.</hi> Out of this Scripture hath of late bin hewen (as I heare) this worthy pillar to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the tottering and ruinous building of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Imputation.</hi> If <hi>every one be curſed, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all things that are written in the Law to doe them,</hi> then can no man be <hi>iuſtified,</hi> but remaines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, who hath not the perfect obſervation of the Law <hi>imputed</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto him: The reaſon is, becauſe no man is able to obtaine any ſuch perſonall obſervation thereof. The argument is not of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent deſert, to have an anſwere beſtowed upon it: yet let us not envie it this honour.

Therefore</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.10. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> if there be no other meanes to diſſolve the Curſe denounced againſt all non-continuers <hi>in all things that are written in the Law to doe them,</hi> but a perfect fulfilling of the Law by <hi>Chriſt imputed unto</hi> them, woe and woe a thouſand times to the world,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:112049:216"/>yea to the whole world of men and women with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. For certaine it is, 1. that there is no ſuch perfect fulfilling of Law <hi>imputed</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto any man, (as hath been prov'd at large through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the firſt part of this diſcourſe) and 2. that were there any ſuch imputation, yet this would not reach the diſſolution of that curſe: this cleaves faſter to the whole generation of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, then to be diſſolved or looſed from any of them by any other meanes, then by the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is not ſaid, that without keeping the Law, but, that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of blood, there is no remiſſion.</hi> Heb. 9.22. <hi>Chriſt</hi> might have kept the Law a 1000 yeeres for us; and yet never have found Juſtification or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the Curſe of the Law for us, had he not bin <hi>made a curſe for us,</hi> by his death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>

Yea I never yet heard of any of that way and judgement, who plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the neceſſity of <hi>Chriſts</hi> active obedience <hi>imputed,</hi> for the bringing men off from the curſe of the Law, but only to bring them under the bleſſing or promiſe of the Law, <hi>Doe this and live.</hi> Therefore the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hand, is no more a friend to that opinion it ſelfe which it ſeekes to eſtabliſh, then it is to the truth it ſelfe. <hi>Falſum, nunc vero, nunc falſo eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>imputation</hi> of a perfect fulfilling of the Law from another, were it granted, cannot make him a continuer <hi>in all things that are written in the Law to doe them,</hi> who <hi>offends</hi> daily <hi>in many things:</hi> and conſequently, will leave him in as bad a caſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the curſe of the Law, as it finds him. All the <hi>imputations</hi> under Heaven, of whatſoever, from whomſoever, cannot make him, who hath <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in all things of the Law to doe them,</hi> to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in them. It is well that this argument is weake: for otherwiſe it is of a moſt bloody and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull Spirit, and would beare downe all the world before it into Hell. If there be no other way or meanes for poore ſinfull men to come off from the curſe of the Law, but by <hi>continuing in all things that are written therein to doe them.</hi> Doubtleſſe they muſt all fall under this curſe, and never riſe againe: Therefore</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) the direct intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this paſſage of Scripture, is this, <hi>Curſed be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that continueth not, &amp;c.</hi> that is, every one that expecteth Juſtification and ſalvation by the Law; woe be to every ſuch perſon, man or woman, if <hi>they continue not in all things that are written in the Law to doe them:</hi> the curſe of the Law will fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and terrible upon them.

               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>28</label> As it is true, that <hi>whatſoever the Law ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> it ſpeaketh to thoſe (that is, to all thoſe) that are under the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. ſo is it as true alſo, that <hi>whatſoever the Law ſpeaketh,</hi> it ſpeaketh only unto thoſe that are under it, and to none other.

                  </gap> of the Law doe no waies concerne or touch any of theſe. So Gal. 5.23. ſpeaking of thoſe that were <hi>Chriſts,</hi> that is, that were <hi>dead to the Law,</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all hope and dependance upon it for <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> and had caſt themſelves upon him for that bleſſing, affirmeth, that <hi>againſt ſuch there was no Law,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Law to judge or condemne them. And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. He denieth that <hi>the Law is given to a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, but unto the lawleſſe and diſobedient, &amp;c.</hi> meaning, that the Law, as touching the curſe and penalty of it, was never intended by <hi>God</hi> for men that are holy and righteous, that is, that are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> from whom all holineſſe and righteouſneſſe proceed. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, the context it ſelfe apparantly leades us to this limitation and interpretation. For 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, the words immediatly preceding in the beginning of the verſe are theſe. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the Law</hi> (that is, that ſeeke to be juſtified by the works of the Law, as <hi>Calvin, Muſculus,</hi> and all Proteſtant writers generally interpret) <hi>are under the Curſe.</hi> To proove this, he alledgeth that teſtimony of the Law mentioned: <hi>For it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not, &amp;c.</hi> So that this clauſe, and the curſe contained in it, have only reference to thoſe that are of the works of the Law, that is, that ſeeke to be juſtified by the Law, and not by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Againe, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, the interpretation given is confirmed from the words of ver. 9. immediatly foregoing: Here he had pronounced thoſe <hi>that were of Faith,</hi> that is, that ſought Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed with faithfull Abraham.</hi> Now to prove that theſe were
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:112049:218"/>the bleſſed ones of <hi>God,</hi> and not thoſe that would be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the Law (which was the Spirit that now began to work among theſe <hi>Galathians</hi>) he affirm's that all theſe are under the curſe, and conſequently farre from being bleſſed. And to prove this, he cites the paſſage in hand from the Law it ſelfe: <hi>Curſed be every one that continueth not, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence alſo, that that <hi>continuance in all things which are written in the Law to do them,</hi> is only required of thoſe, either for the removall of the Curſe threatned, or for the obteyning of the bleſſing promiſed, who ſeeke to be juſtified by the works of the Law, and not of thoſe that beleeve with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and depend upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>juſtification.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, (and laſtly) the tenor of the verſe immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, is as the light of the Sunne, to cleere and vindicate this interpretation. For here the Apoſtle goeth on with the further proofe of his laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>thoſe that are of the works of the Law, are under the Curſe,</hi> thus. <hi>And that no man is juſtified</hi> (and then, not bleſſed, and conſequently accurſed) <hi>by the Law is evident: for the juſt ſhall live</hi> (that is, be juſtified, and ſo live, and be bleſſed) <hi>by Faith,</hi> when he ſaith, that <hi>no man is juſtified by the Law;</hi> he ſuppoſeth that no man can be ſaid <hi>to continue in all things that are written in the Law to doe them:</hi> for he of whom this may be truly affirmed, may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be juſtified by the Law. The truth is, there is no other way or meanes of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> by the Law imaginable but only this. Therefore that <hi>Iuſtification</hi> which we have by Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be by a <hi>continuance in all things that are written in the Law to doe them,</hi> becauſe this is nothing elſe but <hi>Iuſtification</hi> it ſelfe by the Law.</p>
               <p>And whereas it might be objected: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>29</label> but may not a man be <hi>juſtified</hi> by Faith and by the Law, or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe

To this the Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers (by a preoccupation) in the words immediatly following. ver. 12. <hi>And the Law is not of Faith:</hi> that is, a man doth not obſerve the Law in one kind or other by beleeving, he cannot be ſaid to have a legall <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> put upon him by his Faith. This he proveth from the expreſſe tenor and condition of the Law it ſelfe, which requires a perſonall obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things contained therein by every man that ſhall <hi>live,</hi> that is, that ſhall be juſtified thereby: <hi>But the man that doth them, ſhall live in them:</hi> the full importance of which clauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhall finde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the 8.

               <p>Thirdly, when with the Scriptures we affirme, that <hi>God imputeth</hi> or accounteth any mans <hi>Faith unto him for righteouſneſse,</hi> we do not meane that <hi>God</hi> only accounteth ſuch a beleeving for a <hi>righteous</hi> act unto him: much leſſe do we meane, that he eſteemeth it a perfect, literall, and compleate obſervation or fulfilling of the whole Morall Law: but that which we meane, is this, that <hi>God</hi> lookes upon a man who truly beleeveth, with as much grace and favor, and intends to doe as graciouſly and bountifully by him, as if he were a man of perfect <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> and had entirely kept and fulfilled the whole Law.

               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) there is ſcarce any thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed more frequently, or familiarly by the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed writers, then that <hi>God</hi> eſteemes or accounts thoſe juſt, or perfectly juſt, who properly and in exactneſſe and ſtrictneſſe of ſpeech are not ſuch, but only have their ſinnes forgiven. Therefore they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended no matter of unjuſtice or contrarietie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to truth in that, which the objection impeacheth of both. From hence we gather (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>

               <p>If <hi>Faith</hi> (in ſuch a ſenſe) ſhould be <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> then ſhould <hi>juſtification</hi> be by works, or by ſomewhat in our ſelves. But the Scripture every where rejecteth works, and all things in our ſelves from having any thing to doe in <hi>Iuſtification. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere to both propoſitions, and firſt to the major, by diſtinguiſhing the conſequent therein. <hi>That juſtification ſhould be by works, or by ſomewhat in our ſelves,</hi> may be underſtood two waies. Either 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. by way of merit, ſo that <hi>by works,</hi> ſhould ſignifie, by the merit of works, which is ſtill the Scripture ſenſe; or elſe 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. by way of ſimple performance. If the Propoſition be taken in the former ſenſe, it is altogether falſe, and the conſequence thereof denied. <hi>Faith</hi> may be <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> (in the ſenſe oft declared) and yet no man <hi>juſtified</hi> by the merit of any work or works in himſelfe. If it be taken in the latter ſenſe, ſo the minor Propoſition is falſe (to touch upon this in the ſecond place) For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no where rejecteth every thing that may goe under the name of a <hi>worke,</hi> or that may be ſaid to be done by us, in reſpect of a ſimple performance from having to doe in the matter of <hi>juſtification.</hi> Nay it expreſſely requireth of us, and enjoyneth that as of abſolute neceſſitie to <hi>juſtification,</hi> yea and attributeth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:112049:221"/>
                  <hi>Juſtification</hi> to it from place to place, which it ſelfe calleth <hi>a</hi> work. <hi>This is the worke of God</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to the Jewes) <hi>that yee beleeve in him whom he hath ſent.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>worke out their ſalvation with feare and trembling,</hi> doubtleſſe he doth not exclude their Faith or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now that beleeving in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as of abſolute neceſſitie aſwell to <hi>Iuſtification</hi> as ſalvation (at leaſt of thoſe that are <hi>adulti,</hi> and of yeares of diſcretion) is a thing (I conceive) ſo well knowne and of that univerſall confeſſion, that I may forbeare the citation of Scripturs without prejudice to the truth of it. Thus our beſt and ſoundeſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without ſcruple, call that beleeving by which we are <hi>juſtified, a work,</hi> or the <hi>doing</hi> of ſomething.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> That which maketh <hi>Juſtification</hi> not to be of grace, or of free grace, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>4</label> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with the truth of the Goſpell. But the Imputation of <hi>Faith</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> in the ſenſe now contended for, makes <hi>Iuſtification</hi> not to be of Grace. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reverencing the innocencie of the major Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, I come with a rod unto the minor, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> charging this with untruth, and that upon this ground and evidence; becauſe the Scripture ſtill makes or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth a perfect and entire conſiſtence of grace, or free grace, with the condition of <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:112049:222"/>in <hi>Iuſtification. For by Grace yee are ſaved through Faith.</hi> Epheſ. 2.8. <hi>And are freely juſtified by his Grace,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 3.24. <hi>through Faith in his blood,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 25. Nay the truth is, that the worke of beleeving (as our Saviour called it) is ſo farre from carrying any oppoſition in it to the freeneſſe of <hi>Gods</hi> grace in <hi>Juſtification,</hi> that it is purpoſely required of men (and it only) by him, that the freeneſſe of his grace in their <hi>Iuſtification</hi> might take place and be eſtabliſhed thereby. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is by Faith, that it might be by Grace.</hi> And in reaſon, how can a guift be conceived to be more freely given, then when nothing more is required of him to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is given then that he receives it? Now beleeving, is nothing elſe (being interpreted) but a receiving, of that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> or <hi>Iuſtification</hi> which <hi>God</hi> giveth in and with his Sonne <hi>Ieſus Chriſt. As many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 1.12. that is (as it is explained in the end of the verſe) as many as <hi>beleeved</hi> in his Name. So that in the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Faith for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> (in the ſenſe ſo oft explained) there is not the leaſt appearance of any prejudice at all to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace in <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> And thus we are fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered out of the hand of this objection alſo.</p>
               <p>A fourth is this. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>4</label> That which miniſtreth occaſion to the fleſh of boaſting in it ſelfe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>5</label> is no waies conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the tenor and truth of the Goſpell. But the Imputation of <hi>Faith</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> in the ſenſe claimed, miniſtreth this occaſion of boaſting unto the fleſh. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſyllogiſme alſo, as touching the matter of it, halts right downe on the minor propoſition. For certaine it is, that there is no occaſion, nor (indeed) colour of occaſion of boaſting miniſtred to the fleſh, by that opinion, which maintaines the imputation
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:112049:222"/>of <hi>Faith</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> in the ſenſe avouched. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſuppoſe the worke or act of beleeving, which is ſo imputed for <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> be a mans own work or act (which is all the colour that can be pretended why the imputation of it for <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſse,</hi> ſhould be an occaſion of boaſting to the fleſh) yet it is ſo by guift, and by the meere grace and donation of another, <hi>viz. God.</hi> This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle determines in expreſſe words. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through Faith: and that not of your ſelves: it is the guift of God,</hi> that is, that <hi>Faith</hi> by which ye are ſaved is the guift of <hi>God.</hi> See likewiſe <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. with many other places of like importance. Now then, ſince a man hath nothing, doth nothing in beleeving, but what he receiveth from another, all occaſion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of boaſting, is cut off by this, even according to the Apoſtles own rule and reaſoning. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou, that thou haſt not received? and if thou haſt received it, why glorieſt or boaſteſt thou as though thou hadſt not received:</hi> evidently implying, that no man hath any juſt cauſe or pretence of boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting (I meane in, or of himſelfe) for any thing, but only of that which he hath of his own, and from himſelfe. Let the thing be never ſo glorious and excellent, if he hath received it, from another, hee hath cauſe onely to boaſt and glorie in him from whom he hath received it, but not at all in himſelfe. If <hi>God</hi> miracluoſly ſhould <hi>raiſe up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto Abraham of the ſtones of the Earth,</hi> had theſe ſtones, being now made men, and men of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt worth and excellencie, any cauſe or pretence of glorying in themſelves concerning that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and honour which is now come upon them? No more hath any fleſh the leaſt cauſe or colour of boaſting in it ſelfe, how great or excellent ſoever
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:112049:223"/>the act of <hi>Faith</hi> may be conceived to be, or how great and rich ſoever the privileges may be which depend upon it, becauſe it is given unto them by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: it is the glory of the giver, and the comfort only or bleſſedneſſe of the receiver.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>5</label> ſuppoſe the act of believing were from a mans ſelfe, or in part from a mans ſelfe, yet hath he no cauſe to boaſt in himſelfe, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be pleaſed to <hi>impute it</hi> unto him <hi>for righteouſneſse</hi> in the ſenſe we embrace. Becauſe that <hi>weight of glory,</hi> thoſe high and excellent things which attend upon <hi>Faith,</hi> and are given to it, are not given to it for any worth or dignity that is found in it (as we have heretofore cleerely demonſtrated) but by the moſt free, gracious, and good pleaſure of <hi>God.</hi> If a King for taking a pin of a mans ſleeve, ſhould raiſe his Houſe, and make him honourable in the State, and give him thouſands to maintaine it, were it not a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous thing for ſuch a man to goe up and down and bragg of the pin of his ſleeve? Alaſſe, for all this honour and greatneſſe that he is come unto, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the grace and bounty of his Prince, and nothing at all to the pin in his ſleeve. He might have had twenty pins in his ſleeve; and yet never have bin worth twenty pence, had he not met with ſuch a royall and magnificent diſpoſition in him that ſo rewarded him. This is the caſe of <hi>Faith,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe great things which depend upon it: though a Beleever hath the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and the love and favor of <hi>God</hi> given him upon it, and right and title to the Kingdome of Heaven, &amp;c. yet all this is no ground or pretence at all why any man ſhould boaſt of himſelfe or of his Faith, though it were from himſelfe (which yet we abſolutly deny) becauſe if this Faith had not met with a <hi>God</hi> of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, grace, bounty and magnificence, we might have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:112049:223"/>bin miſerable and accurſed for all our Faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving whatſoever. Yea by the Apoſtles own rule, when <hi>God</hi> is pleaſed <hi>to chuſe weake and fooliſh things to confound the mighty,</hi> all occaſion of boaſting is cut off from the fleſh. Indeed if men had fulfilled the Law, and bin <hi>juſtified</hi> that way, there had bin ſome pretence for boaſting or glorying in themſelves. Firſt, becauſe ſuch a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> had held ſome proportion (at leaſt) with the reward that ſhould have bin given to it.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>To him that worketh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) that is, that keepeth the Law, <hi>the wages, or reward is counted, not by favor, but of debt:</hi> God ſhould have given them no more, then what they had (at leaſt in ſome ſort) deſerved. Secondly, becauſe if they had made out their happineſſe that way, they had done it out of themſelves, that is, out of the ſtrength of thoſe abilities which were eſſentiall to their natures, and in the ſtricteſt and moſt proper ſenſe that can be ſpoken of, or applied to, a creature, their owne. Both which being apparantly wanting in Faith, or in the Act of beleeving, there can be no colour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of boaſting for the fleſh, though it be <hi>imputed by God for righteouſneſſe,</hi> as hath bin explained. So that this objection alſo vaniſheth into nothing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To the Major Propoſition I anſwere, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing that clauſe in the conſequent or latter part

Yea the truth is, that <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of Faith for righteouſneſſe</hi> in the ſenſe of the diſcourſe, preſuppoſteth ſomewhat (if not more things then one) that is abſolutly perfect, as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly neceſſary unto <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> Had not the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>perfect</hi> himſelfe, even as <hi>perfect</hi> as <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> it ſelfe could make him, made a <hi>perfect</hi> attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſinne, there had bin no place for the <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſſe:</hi> yea there had bin no place ſo much as for the being either of ſuch a Faith, or of any <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> or <hi>Iuſtification</hi> at all for men. For it is thorough the attonement made by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for us, that either we beleeve in him, or in <hi>God</hi> through him: and it is through the ſame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement alſo, that <hi>God iuſtifieth us,</hi> upon our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that is, imputes our Faith unto us for <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> in the ſenſe argued.</p>
               <p>If the ſaid clauſe be meant in the latter ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſomwhat that is weake and unperfect, may ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concurre or conduce towards <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> ſo the Propoſition is granted; but then the Minor goes to wreck. For <hi>Juſtification</hi> before <hi>God</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and looked for, though that Faith whereby we beleeve, yea and that Miniſter of the Goſpell by
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:112049:224"/>whom we beleeve, be both weake and unperfect, and yet both theſe (we know) are ſomewaies contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie towards <hi>Iuſtification. Except yee beleeve that I am hee, you ſhall die in your ſinnes,</hi> &amp;c. (Joh. 8.24.) and conſequently never be <hi>iuſtified. We have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chriſt Ieſus, that we might be iuſtified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. And that the Miniſter of the Goſpell, hath (or at leaſt may have) his part or hand in our <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> is evident, <hi>How ſhall they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they heare without a Preacher?</hi> Rom. 10.14.

So that the light of this truth ſhines on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hand, that men may be <hi>iuſtified,</hi> miniſterially and inſtrumentally, by things that are weake and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.

                  </label> the Major Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is guilty of the error and falſhood in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. For it no waies followes upon that <hi>imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods</hi> imputing Faith for <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, in the ſenſe which hitherto we have aided, doth no waies imply or import, that Faith is a <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> properly ſo called, but only that <hi>God</hi> by the meanes thereof, and upon the tender of it, looks upon us as <hi>righteous,</hi> yet not as made either merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, or formally <hi>righteous,</hi> by it, but as having fulfilled and performed that condition or covenant, upon the fulfilling and performance whereof, hee hath covenanted and promiſed, to make us <hi>righteous,</hi> meritoriouſly by the death and ſufferings of his own Sonne: formally, with the pardon and remiſſion of all our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe ſuch a poſition or inference as this, lay in the bowells of what we hold, that Faith were a proper <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> yet neither would this argue, that therefore <hi>God ſhould receive a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse from us, in our Iuſtification.</hi> For we rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Faith from <hi>God</hi> (as was layd down in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the fourth objection) for our <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> then <hi>God</hi> from us, in our <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> though I grant, that in a ſenſe a farre off, and with much adoe, it may (haply) be made a truth, that <hi>God</hi> receives our Faith from us in <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> But</p>

But howſoever we have abundantly vindicated the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine aſſerted in this Treatiſe, from all imputations either of <hi>Socinianiſme, Arminianiſme, Popery,</hi> or the like: ſo that we need make no more bridles to put into the lips of theſe uncleane Spirits, yet give me leave to ſuggeſt this for a cloſe of this Chapter; that if every Doctrine, which either <hi>Socinians, Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> hold and maintain, ſhould ſuffer the reproach and infamie either of hereſie, error or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, becauſe they are found in their writings, there are very few Doctrines in that Reformed Religion which we profeſſe, but will be found Matters of that calculation. Eſpecially all thoſe fundamentall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or Doctrines comprehended in that Breviate or Summarie of Chriſtian Religion, called the Apoſtles Creed which (as farre as I underſtand) is generally received and ſubſcribed unto by all Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches without exception, muſt lie under the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, either of <hi>Socinianiſme, Arminianiſme, Popery</hi> or the like; it being certaine that there is none of them

Such paſſionate arguments as theſe may (haply) raviſh the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakneſſe of women and Children, and carie away a great captivity of theſe, and indeed they are exactly calculated for the meridian of their tempers: but men of underſtanding are little affected with them, except it be, as they are arguments of the weakneſſe and inſufficiencie of thoſe that ſo uſe them.</p>

                  <p>But every man that is juſtified, is juſtified by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſse of another, and not by his owne. Ergo. I Anſwere</p>

                  </label> to the major propoſition, by denying it, and oppoſe this contradictory for a truth againſt it: A man may be juſtified by the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of another and not his own, and yet no neceſſitie of the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, of his active obedience (for of this only the queſtion is) to be imputed unto him. The reaſon hereof is more then manifeſt out of what hath bin already delivered: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the paſſive obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and men may be and are, fully and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified by the merit hereof communicated unto them in the free pardon of their ſinnes, without any further <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> derived upon them, either from him or from any other, in a way of imputation, or however. To make this good, there needs nothing be added to what the Reader may pleaſe to finde in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and fift Concluſions premiſ'd in the ſecond Chap. of this latter part. Sect. 4. and 5. p. 567.</p>
               <p>To the minor propoſition, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere </seg>2</label> I anſwere likewiſe, by diſtinguiſhing the <hi>predicaeum,</hi> or latter clauſe of it. A man may be ſaid to be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of another and not by his owne, in a double ſenſe, either 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, by way of merit, or 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, by way of forme. In the firſt ſenſe the propoſition is admitted: whoſoever is juſtified, is <hi>juſtifyed</hi> by the <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of another
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:112049:229"/>and not by his owne, that is, is juſtified by the merit of the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of another, and not by the merit of his owne. But this ſenſe maketh nothing to the point in hand. In the latter ſenſe. it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true: for that <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> wherewith a man is formally juſtified or made <hi>righteous,</hi> is alwaies a mans owne, I meane by donation and poſſeſſion, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, except only in reſpect either of procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo it is <hi>Chriſts;</hi> or of collation, and ſo it is <hi>Gods.</hi> Remiſſion of ſinnes, whereby a beleever is formally juſtified (as hath bin often ſaid, and once at leaſt largely proved
<note n="(a)" place="margin">part 2. c. 4. Sect. 30, 31.32.33.</note>) is a mans owne <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe, as his Repentance or Faith is his own, being all given unto him by <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt. Him hath God lift up with his right hand to be a Prince and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to give Repentance unto Iſrael, and remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> Act. 5.31. Now that which is given unto a man by <hi>God,</hi> may truly and properly be called his owne. There is no merit indeed in remiſſion of ſins, but there is proprietie in it to him that receiveth it.</p>
               <p>A third Argument of Soveraigne eſteeme (as I have perceived) with ſome, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>viz.</hi> reaſon, and truth. Firſt, it wants truth, becauſe a true and reall communion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> may ſtand, without his active obedience being made
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:112049:230"/>theirs by imputation. They that pleaſe may ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of truth in this, by thoſe lights which we have already ſet up, partly chap. 10. Sect. 4. and 5 of the former part, partly againe, chap. 2. Sect. 9 and 10. of this ſecond part. There is a reall union and communion betweene the head and the feet in the ſame naturall body, yet is not the braine, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per functions and operations of the head, made the braine, or functions of the feet by imputation. So there is a reall union and communion betweene the Huſband and the wife in mariage, yet is not the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtrength, or wiſdome of the Husband, made the holineſſe, ſtrength, or wiſdom of the wife, by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Againe 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, as it wants truth, ſo (that which is a want more worthy of blame) it wants reaſon alſo. It hath neither colour nor appearance of truth in it, that that union and communion which beleevers have with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould of neceſſitie implie or draw after it, the appropriation of his active obedience unto them by way of imputation; at leaſt of ſuch an imputation, as is the golden apple for which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries in the preſent queſtion, ſo eagerly contend, that is, ſo that this obedience of his muſt become their formall <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> either in whole, or in part, in <hi>juſtification.</hi> For what poſſible ground of difference can there be found or aſſigned out of that union and communion which interced's betweene <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the beleever, why rather the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> or active obedience, then the wiſdome, or power, or glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould be made the Beleevers, by imputation?</p>

But however it
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:112049:231"/>is a truth of generall acknowledgment, and not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary now to be argued, that the holineſſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, and unblameableneſſe of the lifes of the teachers, have a powerfull influence into the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, to render them more obſervant, and and awfull in their attention to the things which are taught by them, yea and to make thoſe the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſeable, that ſhall deſpiſe their teaching.

               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>7</label> another end of this <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we ſpeake of, is the exemplarineſſe of it: it is <hi>the patterne in the Mount</hi> for all <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie to work by. It is true, the Law it ſelfe is as abſolute and perfect a rule or patterne of <hi>righteouſneſse,</hi> as the conformity or obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe to it, is, but it is not ſo plaine and diſtinct a rule in ſome caſes, as the obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to it. And therefore the Holy Ghoſt ſometimes briefly mentioning the letter or rule of the Law, maketh uſe of the exemplarineſſe of the obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as it were, to illuſtrate and interpret it. <hi>And walke in love, even as Chriſt hath lovedus, and hath given himſelfe for us, &amp;c.</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. with many the like.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the intire obedience and ſubjection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Morall Law, is of excellent importance, and hath a Spirit of provocation in it, to draw all the world after it in imitation of it: it is a tempting righteouſneſte, or an holy, ſtrong and bleſſed temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the world to worke righteouſneſſe, the force and power whereof, no man can withſtand, but with an high hand of deſperate wickedneſſe, and to the deepe ſhame and reproach of his perſon. This end likewiſe is oft mentioned or inſinuated in the Scriptures. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learne of me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour himſelfe <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29.) <hi>for I am meeke and lowly in heart, &amp;c.</hi> implying, that there was in his meekneſſe, not only a patterne or example to follow, but a provocation alſo to make them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to follow. See Epheſ. 5.24.25. 1 Pet. 4.1. with many others.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:112049:232"/>
               <p>Fiftly, the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, was a meanes of continuing his perſon in the love and complacencie of his Father: which was a thing of abſolute neceſſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e for the carrying through and accompliſhing that great worſe of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> which he had undertaken. For if the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator himſelfe, upon whoſe favor and intereſt with <hi>God,</hi> the favor, peace, and ſalvation of the whole world depended, ſhould have but once miſcarried and diſpleaſed him, who ſhould have mediated for him, or made an attonement or reconciliation for him? <hi>If ſalt hath loſt the ſavor,</hi> there is nothing to ſeaſon it againe withall, becauſe all things are to be ſeaſoned by it. This end of his obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Father, himſelfe plainly expreſſeth, Joh. 15.10. <hi>If yee keepe my commandements, you ſhall abide in my love: even as I have kept my Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and abide in his love.</hi> See alſo Joh. 8.29.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we ſpeake of, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>8</label> was of abſolute neceſſitie to qualifie and fit the ſacrifice for the Altar, I meane to render him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon meet by his death and ſacrifice of himſelfe, to make attonement for the world, and to purge and take away the ſinne of it. It is true, the infinitneſſe of the value and conſiderableneſſe of his death, ſprang from the God-head or Divine nature with which the humanitie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had perſonall union: yet was the abſolute <hi>holineſſe</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of the humanitie it ſelfe, of neceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ary concurrence alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and that in two reſpects. Firſt, there is no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in any part or parcell of the humane nature of perſonall union with the Divine, except it be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free from all touch and tincture and ſpot of ſinne: otherwiſe this propoſition might be verified, <hi>that God is ſinfull;</hi> a ſound which neither the eares
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:112049:233"/>nor conſciences of men are able to beare. That <hi>God</hi> ſhould die, though it be a concluſion, which to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not yet taught or principled from above, may ſeeme of the ſame hardneſſe and inconſiſtencie with the other, yet we know it is become not only fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and of eaſy admittance, but of very precious and ſweet importance, in the Schoole of Chriſtianity. But that <hi>God</hi> ſhould finne, is a ſaying of a greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and abhorring to reaſon proſelyted and made Chriſtian, then to reaſon yet only it ſelfe, and no more. Secondly, ſuppoſe (for argument ſake) a poſſibilitie of that which is unpoſſible, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature might be hypoſtatically or perſonally united to an humanity tainted with ſinne, yet could it not give an infinitneſſe of expiatory value or accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto for others, in caſe it were offered or made a ſacrifice by it. The reaſon is, becauſe ſuch an offering or ſacrifice were of abſolute neceſſitie for the expiation of its owne ſinne, or at leaſt it ſhould be due, and the juſtice of <hi>God</hi> might lawfully require it in ſuch a way. For no relation whatſoever of any creature to the Divine nature it ſelfe, or to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſubſiſting therein, be it never ſo neere and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, is able to diſſolve or make voide any right or power which is eſſentiall to <hi>God,</hi> as the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a full ſatisfaction for ſinne is, whereſoever, or in what creature ſoever he findes it. Now then whatſoever <hi>God</hi> either doth or (in juſtice) may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of any man, to make ſatisfaction for his owne ſinne, unpoſſible it is, that with the payment or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof, he ſhould make ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of others, as it is unpoſſible in a courſe of Law and Civill Juſtice, that a man by paying his owne debt, ſhould thereby diſcharge another mans. The High Prieſt under the Law, did not make at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onement for himſelfe, and for the people, with one and the ſame
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:112049:233"/>ſacrifice; but (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>he offered ſacrifice firſt for his owne ſinnes, and then</hi> (needing no further attonement himſelfe) <hi>for the people.</hi> Heb. 7.27. So then evident it is, that howſoever the infiniteneſſe of the merit and ſatisfactorineſſe of the death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath its reſultance and riſe from the Divine nature; yet could no ſuch merit or ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorineſſe have taken place in reſpect of others, had not <hi>Chriſt</hi> as man, or his humane nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſuffered, bin perfectly <hi>righteous,</hi> and free from all ſinne, that ſo he might ſtand in no need at all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that ſacrifice which himſelfe offered of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Dying <hi>righteous</hi> and being <hi>God,</hi> his death holds out weight and worth, merit and ſatisfaction for the whole world; whereas had he died a ſinner in the leaſt degree, though his death by reaſon of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head perſonally united to that created nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in ſuch a caſe he were ſuppoſed to ſuffer, had bin of infinite value and ſatisfaction (for otherwiſe it could not have bin expiatorie for himſelfe, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every whit as much required for the attoning of one mans ſinne, as is for the ſinne of the whole world) yet had the infinitneſſe of this ſatisfaction extended only to himſelfe, and to the purging of his owne ſinne, and not ſo much as to one other. In ſo much that in this caſe, had he meant to have propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated for the world, after he had once died and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame death for himſelfe, he muſt have returned againe into the infirmitie of the fleſh, and have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death the ſecond time. Vpon this conſideration doubtleſſe it is, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> tendering the ſatisfaction and peace of the conſciences of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, touching the fulneſſe and unqueſtionableneſſe of their redemption and ſalvation by the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſtill inſerteth the mention of his perfect <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> when he ſpeaketh of his death or ſufferings
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:112049:234"/>for them. <hi>By his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many: for he ſhall beare their iniquities,</hi> that is, the puniſhment due to their iniquities. <hi>Eſa</hi> 53.11. manifeſtly implying, that there is a great weight and moment in the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> perſon, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ſecure the conſciences of men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their <hi>juſtification</hi> by his death. You may pleaſe at leyſure to peruſe and compare theſe Scriptures further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all (with many more) of the ſame conſideration. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. 23.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus then we have at leaſt diſcovered another great end of the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> or <hi>active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, viz:</hi> the qualification of his perſon (at leaſt in part) for that meritoriouſneſſe of his death which may ſtand the world in ſtead for their <hi>juſtification.</hi> So that there is no neceſſitie at all of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recourſe to the pretended imputation, for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the neceſſitie or uſefulneſſe of it.</p>
               <p>By what we have reaſoned in this laſt paſſage, it appeares how little ſubſtance of truth there is in that which ſome much inſiſt upon, <label type="milestone">

                  </gap>ing the Law. Doubtleſſe the men of this affirmation either do not conſider the neceſſitie of that perſonall integritie in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which we lately demonſtrated, and which the Scriptures from place to place inſinuate: or elſe they conceive that <hi>Chriſt</hi> man, might have bin <hi>righteous</hi> without doing the works of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, without keeping the Law, which is all one, as if they ſhould ſay, he might have bin <hi>righteous,</hi> though he had tranſgreſſed. For not to keepe the Law in thoſe to whom the Law is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:112049:234"/>given, is nothing elſe but to tranſgreſſe. If they thinke to relieve themſelves with this interpretation of their notion, that if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſuffered in the firſt houre or inſtant of his incarnation, or immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the perſonal union of the two natures, his ſacrifice had bin of equall value, merit, and ſatisfaction, with what now it is, and yet in this caſe, he had not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled or kept the Law: I anſwere that this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is every whit as unfound and inconſiſtent with rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on, as the text it ſelfe. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, let this ſuppoſition be admitted, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might have ſuffered in the Womb, and that this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of his had bin as fully ſatisfactorie for the world, as thoſe ſufferings are, which he hath now endured; yet had he bin as perfectly <hi>righteous</hi> in this caſe, and conſequently had obſerv'd and kept the Law as perfectly, as now he hath done. For the Law requireth of Infants during their Infancie, nothing but integritie and holineſſe of nature, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> had from the firſt moment of his conception: &amp; a child or infant thus qualified I meane with holines &amp; integritie of nature, keepeth the Law as perfectly &amp; exactly, as a man living to 30 or 40 yeares of age ſhould do, in caſe he never tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſt.

               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>10</label> this interpretation drawes the ſaying it ſelfe quite beſides the buſineſſe in hand, and makes it a meere impertinencie to the preſent queſtion. For when we affirme, the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> life, or his obedience to the Morall Law, to be of abſolute neceſſitie for the qualification of his perſon for a meet ſacrifice, our meaning is not, that there was an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſitie that he ſhould have kept the Law upon the ſame termes every waies which now he hath done, as that he ſhould performe the ſame individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all acts of obedience, or the ſame number of acts, in caſe he had bin called to the ſuffering of death any whit ſooner, then now he was: but that, untill the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:112049:235"/>very houre and inſtant wherein he ſhould ſuffer, whether it were ſooner or later, he ſhould in all things ſubmit himſelfe unto the good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>God</hi> concerning him aſwell in that generall Law which requires obedience of all men beſides (which we call Morall) as in that particular and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Law of Mediator, which was given unto and impoſed upon himſelfe alone. Such an indefinite <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> as this we judge, and have (I ſuppoſe) unanſwerably proved, to have bin ſimply neceſſarie in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the raiſing of that ſacrifice of himſelfe, to that height of acceptation in the behalfe of others, which now it hath found at the hand of <hi>God.</hi> But however, ſuppoſe this neceſſitie or uſe of the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not be ſufficiently cleared, yet ſince there are many others of undeniable evidence, the poſition ſo much contended for, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>God-head</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſufficiently qualified him for ſuch a ſacrifice as he was, makes nothing at all for the imputation of his <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> in the ſenſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

                  <p>If we be debtors unto the Law, and that not only in matter of puniſhment, deſerved by our diſobedience to it, but in perfection of obedience alſo, then did Chriſt not only ſuffer death for us, that we might be delivered from the puniſhment or curſe due unto our ſinnes, but alſo fulfilled the Law for us, that ſo we may be reputed to have fulfilled the Law in him, or by the imputation of his fulfilling the Law unto us; otherwiſe the Law ſhould yet remaine to be fulfilled by us.</p>
                  <p>But we are debtors unto the Law, not only in matter of puniſhment for our tranſgreſſion, but in perfection of obedience alſo: otherwiſe our ſinning againſt the Law, ſhould exempt and privilege us from ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Law. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                  </label> Therefore (I ſay nothing to the major propoſition, but only in what we ſhall charge upon the minor) to this I anſwere that it labours of an infirmity very incident to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings (eſpecially againſt the truth) called <hi>homony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> or ambiguitie of expreſſion. For when it affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth, that we are debtors to the Law in perfection of obedience, aſwell as in matter of puniſhment; as this debt of obedience may be variouſly interpreted and underſtood, the propoſition may either be true, or falſe. If this be the meaning, that we that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, are debtors unto the Law in perfection of obedience, for our <hi>juſtification,</hi> it is utterly falſe. For
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:112049:236"/>we have no need to depend upon it, or any obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, for our <hi>juſtification</hi> in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> but are fully and freely <hi>juſtified</hi> by <hi>Chriſts</hi> blood. <hi>Ro.</hi> 5.9.

               <p>Secondly, If the propoſition meaneth, that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are debtors of perfect obedience to the Law, in a way of ſanctification and thankfulneſſe unto <hi>God</hi> for that unſpeakable grace of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo it is, and hath bin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acknowledged for a truth cap. 3.

               </q>
               <p>I anſwere briefly, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, by denying the Major, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> by diſtinguiſhing upon the Minor. The reaſon of my
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:112049:241"/>deniall to the Major, is, becauſe <hi>God</hi> may and doth accept that for us, or on our behalfe, which yet hee need not (in the ſenſe contended for in this Treatiſe) impute to us. <hi>God</hi> accepted <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer on the behalfe of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and yet did not impute this prayer to <hi>Iſmael</hi> himſelfe, as if he had prayed it. In like manner he accepted the prayer of <hi>Eliſha</hi> for the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Sonne, and yet did not looke upon the child as if he had made it for himſelfe. It is true in theſe and many other caſes of like conſideration which might be added, the perſons prayed for by others, received benefit by the prayers that were made for them, but there is no colour of reaſon to conceive, that <hi>God</hi> muſt neceſſarily looke upon ſuch prayers, as if they had bin made by the perſons themſelves, for whom they were made, and who were profited by them: It is like they had the greater acceptation with <hi>God,</hi> and prevailed more on the behalfe of thoſe for whom they were made, becauſe they were made by others for them, (eſpecially by perſons of ſuch grace and intereſt with <hi>God</hi> as they were, who did make them) then if they had bin made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In like manner, thoſe on whoſe behalfe <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings were accepted, receive an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bleſſing and benefit by them: but this operates nothing towards ſuch an inference or concluſion as this, that therefore <hi>God</hi> muſt looke upon theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if they had perſonally endured them, on whoſe behalfe they are accepted (which is the imputation principally oppoſed in this Treatiſe) nay ſuch a ſuppoſition or imputation as this, rather tends to deſtroy or prejudice their acceptation, then any waies to further it. The ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (doubtleſſe) have the height of their acceptation with <hi>God</hi> on the behalfe of thoſe that beleeve, becauſe they are look'd upon by him as the ſufferings of himſelfe,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:112049:241"/>I meane of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of no other.</p>
               <p>Againe 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, to the minor, I anſwere likewiſe by Diſtinction. If by the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> the propoſition meaneth, preciſely that obedience which he exhibited to that generall and common Law, whereunto all other men are oblieged, conſidered apart from his obedience to that peculiar Law of Mediator, given to himſelfe alone, ſo it is altogether falſe. For <hi>God</hi> did not accept this <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on our behalfe, ſo, or upon ſuch termes as to juſtifie us, either with it, or for it, as hath bin ten times ſaid, and oft enough proved already. If by this <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> be meant that obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> commonly knowne by the name of Paſſive, or both Active and Paſſive together, ſo this propoſition may be granted: <hi>but then</hi> the other will be found tar die, as hath bin ſhewed, unleſſe we make foure termes in the ſyllogiſme inſtead of three, by taking the ſame words in one ſenſe in the Major, and in another ſenſe in the Minor; and then it is no longer a ſyllogiſme, but a Paralogiſme. So that neither can this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do any thing. Therefore let us further trie the ſtrength of thoſe that are yet behind.</p>
               <p>Some conceive that the imputation of <hi>Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> (in the ſenſe taken and left) may be firmly eſtabliſhed upon the publiqueneſle of his perſon, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> I charge the former Propoſition with weakneſſe and untruth. Becauſe the publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Chriſts</hi> perſon, or his ſtanding in the place of thoſe that ſhould beleeve, is no ſufficient ground to build this inference upon; <hi>therefore all that he did, and all that he ſuffered, are looked upon by God., as done or ſuffered by them.</hi> This is evident: his conception, incarnation, birth, circumciſion, ſubjection to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his ſuppoſed Father, his appoſing the Doctors in the Temple, his whipping the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, his Redemption of the world, with other particulars more of like conſideration without number, were all, either things done, or ſuffered by him: yet are they not looked upon by <hi>God</hi> as done, or ſuffered by all thoſe that beleeve in him. For to what purpoſe (for example) ſhould I, being a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Gentile,</hi> and ſo not only free from the Yoke of <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, but further, under command not to uſe them, be looked upon by <hi>God</hi> as one circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? ſo what can it in reaſon advantage me, to be look'd upon by <hi>God,</hi> as one who in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto <hi>Ioſeph?</hi> eſpecially how ſhall I not feare and tremble, to take the leaſt hold of ſuch a conceipt, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould looke upon me, as having redeemed the world, which yet was one of the greateſt acts that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did? Therefore this propoſition is no Oracle. Princes and Magiſtrates are publique perſons: yet <hi>God</hi> forbid that all that they doe, ſhould be look'd upon by <hi>God,</hi> as done by all thoſe that are in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under them. <hi>Adam</hi> was as publique a perſon (yea and more publique, in a ſenſe) then <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; yea and is conceived by the moſt, to have
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:112049:242"/>ſtood as much in the place or ſtead of his poſteritie, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did in the ſtead of his, I meane of thoſe that were-to deſcend Spiritually from him by Faith: (though for my ſelfe, I had rather demurre, then joyne iſſue in this) And yet how ridiculous is it on the one hand, and of dangerous conſequence on the other, to ſuppoſe that all that <hi>Adam</hi> did, and all that very poſſibly he might have done, either may, or might have bin ſo imputed to all his poſteritie, as if they had done it? Of what advantage or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can it be unto me, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould looke upon me, as one that <hi>gave Names to all Cattell, and to the foules of Heaven, and to every Beaſt of the Field,</hi> which yet <hi>Adam</hi> did? <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.20. Or as upon one, that firſt propagated man-kinde, and begat <hi>Cain,</hi> which we know were done by <hi>Adam?</hi> with twenty things more of like nature. In caſe he had ſtood, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> the publiqueneſſe of his perſon had bin no waies touched, nor impaired here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and yet is it of very doubtfull importance, to conceive, that all that <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> in this caſe had wrought, ſhould have bin look'd upon as the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of all his poſteritie, and imputed to them for their <hi>Juſtification;</hi> For from hence it would follow, 10, that all his poſteritie ſhould have bin ſaved, 20, that they ſhould all have bin ſinleſſe: which are two principall regions of <hi>terra incognita:</hi> 30, (and laſtly) that they ſhould all have bin <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by a double <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> one perſonall and wrought by themſelves, another imputative, wrought by another: and ſo (in this reſpect at leaſt) ſhould have bin better provided for their <hi>juſtification,</hi> then thoſe that are now <hi>juſtified</hi> by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

If a man undertakes the ordering and iſſuing of ſuch a buſineſſe for me, and deales diſhoneſtly or unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably with others therin, and at laſt makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion with much damage and diſadvantage to me, which might be a wiſe and ſaire cariage of things on my behalfe, have bin prevented; I am in this caſe liable to ſuffer all the detriment and damage, which the unconſcionableneſſe, or weakneſſe of my Agent hath brought upon me: but I am not to be look'd upon, as one that have uſ'd the ſame unconſcionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with him, or as if his weakneſſe were mine. Or in caſe he had dealt wiſely or faithfully for me, and had brought my buſineſſe to a good end or iſſue; I here receive benefit and good by ſuch a mans wiſdome and faithfulneſſe: but theſe are not aſcribed orimputed unto me, as mine owne, becauſe he was my Agent that uſed them. The Client that prevailes againſt his adverſary before the Judge, by the skill of his Advocate or Lawyer, is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:112049:243"/>not therefore reputed as skilfull in the Law, as his Advocate, nor to have pleaded his own cauſe as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially and effectually, as his Lawyer did. In like manner, as farre as <hi>Adam</hi> had a Commiſſion or power from <hi>God</hi> to deale for me, or in my affaires, being one of his poſteritie, I am bound to undergoe and ſuffer my ſhare in that evill or miſerie which he brought upon the world, through his weakneſſe or unfaithfulneſſe in that tranſaction: but this weakneſſe or unfaithfulneſſe of his as a Commiſſioner for me, is not look'd upon as my perſonall weakneſſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe; only ſo farre as my perſon was in his, they are aſcribed and imputed unto me as mine own. See for this cap. 2. Sect. 11. of this ſecond part. So againe on the other hand, as farre as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a power from <hi>God</hi> to deale for me, and in mine affaires, being one that beleeve in him, I have my part and portion in that bleſſed end and iſſue whereunto by his holineſſe, wiſdome, faithfulneſſe and patience he brought the affaires of the world entruſted in his had: but God doth never the more looke upon me, as if that holineſſe, wiſdome, faithfulneſſe and patience, had bin mine, nor is it any waies neceſſary that he ſhould, to make me capable of that which falls to my ſhare as I am a beleever, in that great and bleſſed tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly (to part with this argument alſo upon ſuch terms, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>21</label> that we may never need to meete more) neither is it altogether ſo ſolid or ſound a truth, as haply is ſuppoſed, that <hi>Chriſt ſtood in the place or ſtead of thoſe that ſhould beleeve in him,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in all things performed by him, and which tended to the qualification of his perſon, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of that great work of Redemption. To ſtand in the place or ſtead of another, implies a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of his being in the ſame place, and doing the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:112049:244"/>ſame things himſelfe wherin he ſtands, and which he doth, who is ſuppoſed to ſtand in his ſtead, unleſſe they had bin done by this other for him. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> did a thouſand things, yea and ſuffered many, for the doing and ſuffering wherof, there lay no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall neceſſitie upon many Beleevers, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> had done or ſuffered them, or no. As for example, there was no neceſſitie, either in way of duty, or of penaltie, lying upon any Beleever, one or other, to be conceived or borne of a virgin, to turne water into wine, to command the winds and the Seas, to ordain Apoſtles, or the like. Againe there was no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie lying upon any beleeving Gentile to have bin cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, to have bin in ſubjection unto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> to have eaten the Paſſeover at <hi>Hieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all theſe Paſſages of his life, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is full evident that he ſtood not in the place or ſtead of all Beleevers, All that the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in this caſe is, that <hi>he ſuffered for us, was made a curſe for us, &amp;c.</hi> which expreſſions, though they imply indeed (in the generall) a neceſſitie of our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, unleſſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſuffered for us, yet do they not imply a neceſſitie of our ſufferings in the ſame kinde, or after the ſame manner, in all particulars. It doeth not follow, that except <hi>Chriſt</hi> had bin cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, we muſt have bin circumciſed, except he had faſted 40 daies we muſt have faſted 40. except he had bin ſcourged with rods, or crucified on a Croſſe, we muſt of neceſſitie have bin ſcourged or crucified: only it followes, that except <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſuffered either in theſe or ſome other particulars, as ſatisfactorie to divine wiſdome and juſtice as theſe, we muſt have ſuffered, and that moſt grievouſly. Therefore it is not every waies ſo ſquare a truth, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even in his ſufferings themſelves particularly conſidered, ſtood in our ſtead. But the Scriptures
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:112049:244"/>which oft ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered for us, died for as, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> never ſay, that either he kept the Morall or Ceremoniall Law, nor any part of either for us; though this expreſſion may be admitted, without granting that he did theſe in our ſtead. See cap. 3. Sect. 11. of this ſecond part. And thus we ſee that this argument alſo is defective on every ſide.</p>

For certame it is, that no ſuch imputation can ſtand, as hath bin proved by three demonſtrations and by foure, and by many more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them, in the firſt part of this Diſcourſe. But the weakneſſe of the Propoſition is ſufficiently evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from hence, becauſe that <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> mentioned in it, concurr's towards <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> by qualifying his perſon for that ſacrifice of himſelfe, by which <hi>Iuſtification</hi> or remiſſion of ſinnes, hath bin purchaſed for all thoſe that beleeve, as hath bin o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at large in an anſwere to a former argument.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:112049:246"/>from the death <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. or elſe the new life it ſelfe, raiſed and wrought in us, by that quickning and riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the dead. In the former ſenſe, you ſhall finde one of them uſed <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Jf ye be riſen with Chriſt,</hi> that is, ſince you make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that new and excellent life, which anſwers the life which <hi>Chriſt</hi> lived upon, and after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, give this account and evidence of it unto the world, <hi>ſeeke the things that are above, &amp;c.</hi> In the latter ſenſe, you may finde the other <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Even when we were dead in ſinnes, hath quickened us together with</hi> Chriſt, meaning that GOD by the quickening and raiſing of Chriſt from the dead, had begotten them (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes) to ſuch a life, which ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually anſwereth that quickening and riſing againe of Chriſt. But on the other hand, as there is no ſuch expreſſion in Scripture as this, we have fulfilled the Law with Chriſt: ſo neither if there were, would it make any thing at all to ſalve the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition under queſtion, if the ſenſe and meaning of it were caried according to the line of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of thoſe other expreſſions mentioned. For what if we ſhould be ſaid either to profeſſe ſuch a fulfilling of the Law, which holds a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall analogie or proportion with Chriſts fulfilling the Law, or really and perſonally to fulfill the Law after ſuch a manner: were there any thing in this to inferre an imputation of Chriſts perſonal fulfilling the Law, in the letter and formalitie thereof unto us? Doubtleſſe Chriſt's quickening and riſing againe, are not in the letter and formalitie of them imputed unto the Saints for their quickening and riſing againe, in the ſame manner: if they were, <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> had bin no Heretiques, for teaching that <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was paſt already.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.18. Therefore neither is there any thing in this reaſon, more then
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:112049:246"/>in its fellowes, to repaire the breaches that have bin made upon that imputation, which with them it ſeeks to fortifie.</p>

                  <p>But every man (Chriſt excepted) is a ſinner, and ſo continueth whilſt he lives. Therefore no man can be juſtified but by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                  </label> though the truth is, that more then an anſwere hath bin given already.</p>
               <p>I repeate therefore, rather then adde (in reference to the former Propoſition) that if there be no other way or means for the <hi>juſtifying</hi> of a ſinner, then by the imputation of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe</hi> (in the ſenſe ſo often ſentenced) doubtleſſe the condition of the whole world is miſerable and help-leſſe: there is no way or dore of life yet opened unto ſinners. For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> upon ſuch terms there is none; as hath bin largly proved, and (if I be not miſtaken) beyond all reaſonable deniall, throughout the bodie of this diſcourſe.
